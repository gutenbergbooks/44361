<p>Africa, the least explored division
of the globe's surface, and the best
field for travellers of bold and enterprising
character, has been the scene
of three of the most remarkable books
of their class that have appeared
within the last ten years. We refer
to Major Harris's narrative of his
Ethiopian expedition&mdash;to the marvellous
adventures of that modern Nimrod,
Mr Gordon Cumming&mdash;to Mr
Ferdinand Werne's strange and exciting
account of his voyage up the
White Nile. In our review of the
last-named interesting and valuable
work,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we mentioned that Mr Werne,
previously to his expedition up the
Nile, had been for several months in
the Taka country, a region previously
untrodden by Europeans, with an
army commanded by Achmet Bascha,
governor-general of the Egyptian province
of Bellad-Sudan, who was operating
against refractory tributaries.
He has just published an account of
this campaign, which afforded him,
however, little opportunity of expatiating
on well-contested battles,
signal victories, or feats of heroic
valour. On the other hand, his
narrative abounds in striking incidents,
in curious details of tribes
and localities that have never before
been described, and in perils and
hardships not the less real and painful
that they proceeded from no
efforts of a resolute and formidable
foe, but from the effects of a pernicious
climate, and the caprice and
negligence of a wilful and indolent
commander.</p>

<p>It was early in 1840, and Mr Werne
and his youngest brother Joseph had
been resident for a whole year at
Chartum, chief town of the province
of Sudan, in the country of Sennaar.
Chartum, it will be remembered by
the readers of the "Expedition for
the Discovery of the Sources of the
White Nile," is situated at the confluence
of the White and Blue streams,
which, there uniting, flow northwards
through Nubia and Egypt Proper to
Cairo and the Mediterranean; and at
Chartum it was that the two Wernes
had beheld, in the previous November,
the departure of the first expedition
up Nile, which they were forbidden
to join, and which met with
little success. The elder Werne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
whose portrait&mdash;that of a very determined-looking
man, bearded, and in
Oriental costume&mdash;is appended to the
present volume, appears to have been
adventurous and a rambler from his
youth upwards. In 1822 he had
served in Greece, and had now been
for many years in Eastern lands.
Joseph Werne, his youngest and favourite
brother, had come to Egypt
at his instigation, after taking at Berlin
his degree as Doctor of Medicine,
to study, before commencing practice,
some of the extraordinary diseases
indigenous in that noxious climate.
Unfortunately, as recorded in Mr
Werne's former work, this promising
young man, who seems to have possessed
in no small degree the enterprise,
perseverance, and fortitude so
remarkable in his brother, ultimately
fell a victim to one of those fatal maladies
whose investigation was the
principal motive of his visit to Africa.
The first meeting in Egypt of the two
brothers was at Cairo; and of it a
characteristic account is given by the
elder, an impetuous, we might almost
say a pugnacious man, tolerably
prompt to take offence, and upon
whom, as he himself says at page 67,
the Egyptian climate had a violently
irritating effect.</p>

<p>"Our meeting, at Guerra's tavern
in Cairo, was so far remarkable, that
my brother knew me immediately,
whilst I took him for some impertinent
Frenchman, disposed to make
game of me, inasmuch as he, in the
petulance of his joy, fixed his eyes
upon me, measuring me from top to
toe, and then laughed at the fury
with which I rushed upon him, to
call him to an account, and, if necessary,
to have him out. We had not
seen each other for eight years, during
which he had grown into a man,
and, moreover, his countenance had
undergone a change, for, by a terrible
cut, received in a duel, the muscle of
risibility had been divided on one
side, and the poor fellow could laugh
only with half his face. In the first
overpowering joy of our meeting in
this distant quarter of the globe, we
could not get the wine over our
tongues, often as my Swiss friend De
Salis (over whose cheeks the tears
were chasing each other) and other
acquaintances struck their glasses
against ours, encouraging us to drink....
I now abandoned the hamlet
of Tura&mdash;situated in the desert, but
near the Nile, about three leagues
above Cairo, and whither I had
retreated to do penance and to work
at my travels&mdash;as well as my good
friend Dr Schledehaus of Osnabruck,
(then holding an appointment at the
military school, now director of the
marine hospital of Alexandria,) with
whom my brother had studied at
Bonn, and I hired a little house in
the Esbekie Square in Cairo. After
half an hour's examination, Joseph
was appointed surgeon-major, with
the rank of a Sakulagassi or captain,
in the central hospital of Kasr-el-Ain,
with a thousand piastres a
month, and rations for a horse and
four servants. Our views constantly
directed to the interior of Africa, we
suffered a few months to glide by in
the old city of the Khalifs, dwelling
together in delightful brotherly harmony.
But our thirst for travelling
was unslaked; to it I had sacrificed
my appointment as chancellor of the
Prussian Consulate at Alexandria;
Joseph received his nomination as
regimental surgeon to the 1st regiment
in Sennaar, including that of
physician to the central hospital at
Chartum. Our friends were concerned
for us on account of the
dangerous climate, but, nevertheless,
we sailed with good courage up the
Nile, happy to escape from the noise
of the city, and to be on our way to
new scenes."</p>

<p>A stroke of the sun, received near
the cataract of Ariman in Upper
Nubia, and followed by ten days'
delirium, soon convinced the younger
Werne that his friends' anxiety on
his behalf was not groundless. During
the whole of their twelvemonth's
stay at Chartum, they were mercilessly
persecuted by intermittent
fever, there most malignant, and
under whose torturing and lowering
attacks their sole consolation was
that, as they never chanced both to
be ill together, they were able
alternately to nurse each other. At
last, fearing that body or mind would
succumb to these reiterated fever-fits,
and the first expedition up the
White Nile having, to their great
disgust and disappointment, sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
without them, they made up their
minds to quit for ever the pestiferous
Chartum and the burning steppes of
Bellad-Sudan. Whilst preparing for
departure, they received a visit from
the chief Cadi, who told them, over
a glass of cardinal&mdash;administered by
Dr Werne as medicine, to evade his
Mahomedan scruples&mdash;that Effendina
(Excellency) Achmet Bascha was
well pleased with the brotherly love
they manifested, taking care of each
other in sickness, and that they would
do well to pay their respects occasionally
at the Divan. This communication
was almost immediately
followed by the arrival at Chartum of
Dr Gand, physician to Abbas Bascha.
This gentleman had been a comrade
of Ferdinand Werne's in Greece, and
he recommended the two brothers to
Achmet, with whom he was intimate,
in true Oriental style, as men of universal
genius and perfect integrity, to
whom he might intrust both his body
and his soul. The consequence of this
liberal encomium was, that Achmet
fixed his eyes upon them to accompany
him, in the capacity of confidential
advisers, upon a projected campaign.
Informed of this plan and of the
advantages it included, the Wernes
joyfully abandoned their proposed
departure. Joseph was to be made
house-physician to Achmet and his
harem, as well as medical inspector
of the whole province, in place of
Soliman Effendi, (the renegade Baron
di Pasquali of Palermo,) a notorious
poisoner, in whose hands the Bascha
did not consider himself safe. Ferdinand
Werne, who had held the rank of
captain in Greece, was made <i>bimbaschi</i>
or major, and was attached, as
engineer, to Achmet's person, with
good pay and many privileges. "At
a later period he would have made
me bey, if I&mdash;not on his account,
for he was an enlightened Circassian,
but on that of the Turkish jackasses&mdash;would
have turned Mussulman. I
laughed at this, and he said no more
about it." Delighted to have secured
the services of the two Germans,
Achmet ordered it to be reported
to his father-in-law, Mehemet Ali,
for his approval, and took counsel
with his new officers concerning the
approaching campaign. Turk-like,
he proposed commencing it in the
rainy season. Mr Werne opposed
this as likely to cost him half his
army, the soldiers being exceedingly
susceptible to rain, and advised the
erection of blockhouses at certain
points along the line of march where
springs were to be found, to secure
water for the troops. The Bascha
thought this rather a roundabout
mode of proceeding, held his men's
lives very cheap, and boasted of his
seven hundred dromedaries, every one
of which, in case of need, could carry
three soldiers. His counsellors were
dismissed, with injunctions to secresy,
and on their return home they found
at their door, as a present from the
Bascha, two beautiful dromedaries,
tall, powerful, ready saddled for a
march, and particularly adapted for a
campaign, inasmuch as they started
not when muskets were fired between
their ears. A few days later, Mr
Werne was sent for by Achmet, who,
when the customary coffee had been
taken, dismissed his attendants by a
sign, and informed him, with a gloomy
countenance, that the people of Taka
refused to pay their <i>tulba</i>, or tribute.
His predecessor, Churdschid Bascha,
having marched into that country,
had been totally defeated in a <i>chaaba</i>,
or tract of forest. Since that time,
Achmet mournfully declared, the
tribes had not paid a single piastre,
and he found himself grievously in
want of money. So, instead of marching
south-westward to Darfour, as he
had intended, he would move north-eastward
to Taka, chastise the stubborn
insolvents, and replenish the
coffers of the state. "Come with
me," said he, to Mr Werne; "upon
the march we shall all recover our
health," (he also suffered from frequent
and violent attacks of fever;)
"yonder are water and forests, as in
Germany and Circassia, and very
high mountains." It mattered little
to so restless and rambling a spirit as
Mr Ferdinand Werne whether his
route lay inland towards the Mountains
of the Moon, or coastwards to
the Red Sea. His brother was again
sick, and spoke of leaving the country;
but Mr Werne cheered him up,
pointed out to him upon the map an
imaginary duchy which he was to
conquer in the approaching war, and
revived an old plan of going to settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at Bagdad, there to practise as physician
and apothecary. "We resolved,
therefore, to take our passports with
us, so that, if we chose, we might
embark on the Red Sea. By this
time I had seen through the Bascha,
and I resolved to communicate to him
an idea which I often, in the interest
of these oppressed tribes, had revolved
in my mind, namely, that he should
place himself at their head, and renounce
obedience to the Egyptian
vampire. I did subsequently speak
to him of the plan, and it might have
been well and permanently carried
out, had he not, instead of striving to
win the confidence of the chiefs,
tyrannised over them in every possible
manner. Gold and regiments!
was his motto."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the influential Dr Gand
had fallen seriously ill, and was so
afflicted with the irritability already
referred to as a consequence of the
climate, that no one could go near
him but the two Wernes. He neglected
Joseph's good advice to quit
Chartum at once, put it off till it was
too late, and died on his journey
northwards. His body lay buried for
a whole year in the sand of the desert;
then his family, who were going to
France, dug it up to take with them.
Always a very thin man, little more
than skin and bone, the burning sand
had preserved him like a mummy.
There was no change in his appearance;
not a hair gone from his mustaches.
Strange is the confusion and
alternation of life and death in that
ardent and unwholesome land of
Nubia. To-day in full health, to-morrow
prostrate with fever, from
which you recover only to be again
attacked. Dead, in twenty-four
hours or less corruption is busy on
the corpse; bury it promptly in the
sand, and in twelve months you may
disinter it, perfect as if embalmed.
At Chartum, the very focus of disease,
death, it might be thought, is
sufficiently supplied by fever to need
no other purveyors. Nevertheless
poisoning seems a pretty common
practice there. Life in Chartum is
altogether, by Mr Werne's account,
a most curious thing. During the
preparations for the campaign, a
Wurtemberg prince, Duke Paul William
of Mergentheim, arrived in the
place, and was received with much
pomp. "For the first time I saw the
Bascha sit upon a chair; he was in
full uniform, a red jacket adorned
with gold, a great diamond crescent,
and three brilliant stars upon his left
breast, his sabre by his side." The
prince, a fat good-humoured German,
was considerably impressed by the
state displayed, and left the presence
with many obeisances. The next
day he dined with the Bascha, whom
he and the Wernes hoped to see
squatted on the ground, and feeding
with his fingers. They were disappointed;
the table was arranged in
European fashion; wine of various
kinds was there, especially champagne,
(which the servants, notwithstanding
Werne's remonstrances, insisted
on shaking before opening, and
which consequently flew about the
room in foaming fountains;) bumper-toasts
were drunk; and the whole
party, Franks and Turks, seem to
have gradually risen into a glorious
state of intoxication, during which
they vowed eternal friendship to each
other in all imaginable tongues; and
the German prince declared he would
make the campaign to Taka with the
Bascha, draw out the plan, and overwhelm
the enemy. This jovial meeting
was followed by a quieter entertainment
given by the Wernes to the
prince, who declared he was travelling
as a private gentleman, and
wished to be treated accordingly;
and then Soliman Effendi, the Sicilian
renegade, made a respectful application
for permission to invite the
"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Altezza Tedesca</i>," for whom he had
conceived a great liking. A passage
from Mr Werne is here worth quoting,
as showing the state of society at
Chartum. "I communicated the
invitation, with the remark that the
Sicilian was notorious for his poisonings,
but that I had less fear on his
highness' account than on that of my
brother, who was already designated
to replace him in his post. The
prince did not heed the danger;
moreover, I had put myself on a
peculiar footing with Soliman Effendi,
and now told him plainly that he had
better keep his vindictive man&oelig;uvres
for others than us, for that my brother
and I should go to dinner with loaded
pistols in our pockets, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
shoot him through the head (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">brucciare
il cervello</i>) if one of us three felt as
much as a belly-ache at his table.
The dinner was served in the German
fashion; all the guests came, except
Vaissière (formerly a French captain,
now a slave-dealer, with the cross of
the legion of honour.) He would not
trust Soliman, who was believed to
have poisoned a favourite female-slave
of his after a dispute they had
about money matters. The dinner
went off merrily and well. The duke
changed his mind about going to Taka,
but promised to join in the campaign
on his return from Fàszogl, and bade
me promise the Bascha in his name
a crocodile-rifle and a hundred bottles
of champagne."</p>

<p>Long and costly were the preparations
for the march; the more so that
Mr Werne and his brother, who saw
gleaming in the distance the golden
cupolas of Bagdad, desired to take all
their baggage with them, and also
sufficient stores for the campaign&mdash;not
implicitly trusting to the Bascha's
promise that his kitchen and table
should be always at their service.
Ten camels were needed to carry the
brothers' baggage. One of their
greatest troubles was to know how to
dispose of their collection of beasts
and birds. "The young maneless
lion, our greatest joy, was dead&mdash;Soliman
Effendi, who was afraid of
him, having dared to poison him, as
I learned, after the renegade's death,
from one of our own people." But of
birds there were a host; eagles, vultures,
king-cranes, (<i>grus pavonina</i>,
Linn.;) a snake-killing secretary, with
his beautiful eagle head, long tail, and
heron legs; strange varieties of water-fowl,
many of which had been shot,
but had had the pellets extracted and
the wounds healed by the skill of Dr
Werne; and last, but most beloved,
"a pet black horn-bird, (<i>buceros
abyss.</i> L.,) who hopped up to us when
we called out 'Jack!'&mdash;who picked up
with his long curved beak the pieces of
meat that were thrown to him, tossed
them into the air and caught them
again, (whereat the Prince of Wurtemberg
laughed till he held his sides,)
because nature has provided him with
too short a tongue; but who did not
despise frogs and lizards, and who
called us at daybreak with his persevering
'<em>Hum, hum</em>,' until we roused
ourselves and answered 'Jack.'"
Their anxiety on account of their
aviary was relieved by the Bascha's
wife, who condescendingly offered to
take charge of it during their absence.
Mehemet Ali's daughter suffered
dreadfully from ennui in dull, unwholesome
Chartum, and reckoned
on the birds and beasts as pastime
and diversion. Thus, little by little,
difficulties were overcome, and all
was made ready for the march. A
Bolognese doctor of medicine, named
Bellotti, and Dumont, a French apothecary,
arrived at Chartum. They
belonged to an Egyptian regiment,
and must accompany it on the <i>chasua</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Troops assembled in and around
Chartum, the greater part of whose
garrison, destined also to share in the
campaign, were boated over to the
right bank of the Blue Nile. Thence
they were to march northwards to
Damer&mdash;once a town, now a village
amidst ruins&mdash;situated about three
leagues above the place where the
Atbara, a river that rises in Abyssinia,
and flows north-westward through
Sennaar, falls into the Nile. There
the line of march changed its direction
to the right, and took a tolerably
straight route, but inclining a little to
the south, in the direction of the Red
Sea. The Bascha went by water
down the Nile the greater part of the
way to Damer, and was of course
attended by his physician. Mr Werne,
finding himself unwell, followed his
example, sending their twelve camels
by land, and accompanied by Bellotti,
Dumont, and a Savoyard merchant
from Chartum, Bruno Rollet by name.
There was great difficulty in getting
a vessel, all having been taken for the
transport of provisions and military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
stores; but at last one was discovered,
sunk by its owner to save it from the
commissariat, and after eleven days
of sickness, suffering, and peril&mdash;during
which Mr Werne, when burning
with fever, had been compelled to
jump overboard to push the heavy
laden boat off the reef on which the
stupid Rëis had run it&mdash;the party
rejoined headquarters. There Mr
Werne was kindly received by Achmet,
and most joyfully by his brother.
Long and dolorous was the tale Dr
Joseph had to tell of his sufferings
with the wild-riding Bascha. Three
days before reaching Damer, that impatient
chieftain left his ship and
ordered out the dromedaries. The
Berlin doctor of medicine felt his heart
sink within him; he had never yet
ascended a dromedary's saddle, and the
desperate riding of the Bascha made
his own Turkish retinue fear to follow
him. His forebodings were well-founded.
Two hours' rough trot shook
up his interior to such an extent, and
so stripped his exterior of skin, that
he was compelled to dismount and lie
down upon some brushwood near the
Nile, exposed to the burning sun, and
with a compassionate Bedouin for sole
attendant, until the servants and
baggage came up. Headache, vomiting,
terrible heat and parching thirst&mdash;for
he had no drinking vessel, and
the Bedouin would not leave him&mdash;were
his portion the whole day, followed
by fever and delirium during
the night. At two o'clock the next
day (the hottest time) the Bascha
was again in the saddle, as if desirous
to try to the utmost his own endurance
and that of his suite. By this
time the doctor had come up with
him, (having felt himself better in the
morning,) after a six hours' ride, and
terrible loss of leather, the blood running
down into his stockings. Partly
on his dromedary, partly on foot, he
managed to follow his leader through
this second day's march, at the cost
of another night's fever, but in the
morning he was so weak that he was
obliged to take boat and complete his
journey to Damer by water. Of more
slender frame and delicate complexion
than his brother, the poor doctor was
evidently ill-adapted for roughing it
in African deserts, although his pluck
and fortitude went far towards supplying
his physical deficiencies. Most
painful are the accounts of his constantly
recurring sufferings during
that arduous expedition; and one
cannot but admire and wonder at the
zeal for science, or ardent thirst for
novelty, that supported him, and
induced him to persevere in the teeth
of such hardship and ill-health. At
Damer he purchased a small dromedary
of easy paces, and left the
Bascha's rough-trotting gift for his
brother's riding.</p>

<p>At three in the afternoon of the
20th March, a cannon-shot gave the
signal for departure. The Wernes'
water-skins were already filled and
their baggage packed; in an instant
their tents were struck and camels
loaded; with baggage and servants
they took their place at the head of
the column and rode up to the Bascha,
who was halted to the east of Damer,
with his beautiful horses and dromedaries
standing saddled behind him.
He complained of the great disorder
in the camp, but consoled himself
with the reflection that things would
go better by-and-by. "It was truly
a motley scene," says Mr Werne.
"The Turkish cavalry in their national
costume of many colours, with
yellow and green banners and small
kettle-drums; the Schaïgië and Mograbin
horsemen; Bedouins on horseback,
on camels, and on foot; the
Schechs and Moluks (little king) with
their armour-bearers behind them on
the dromedaries, carrying pikes and
lances, straight swords and leather
shields; the countless donkeys and
camels&mdash;the former led by a great
portion of the infantry, to ride in
turn&mdash;drums and an ear-splitting
band of music, The Chabir (caravan-leader)
was seen in the distance
mounted on his dromedary, and armed
with a lance and round shield; the
Bascha bestrode his horse, and we
accompanied him in that direction,
whilst gradually, and in picturesque
disorder, the detachments emerged
from the monstrous confusion and followed
us. The artillery consisted of
two field-pieces, drawn by camels,
which the Bascha had had broken to
the work, that in the desert they
might relieve the customary team of
mules.</p>

<p>"Abd-el-Kader, the jovial Topschi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Baschi, (chief of the artillery,) commanded
them, and rode a mule. The
Turks, (that is to say, chiefly Circassians,
Kurds, and Arnauts or Albanians,)
who shortly before could hardly
put one leg before the other, seemed
transformed into new men, as they
once more found themselves at home
in their saddles. They galloped
round the Bascha like madmen, riding
their horses as mercilessly as if they
had been drunk with opium. This
was a sort of honorary demonstration,
intended to indicate to their chief their
untameable valour. The road led
through the desert, and was tolerably
well beaten. Towards evening
the Bascha rode forwards with the
Chabir. We did not follow, for I
felt myself unwell. It was dark
night when we reached the left bank
of the Atbara, where we threw
ourselves down amongst the bushes,
and went to sleep, without taking
supper."</p>

<p>The campaign might now be said
to be beginning; at least the army
was close upon tribes whose disposition,
if not avowedly hostile, was very
equivocal, and the Bascha placed a
picket of forty men at the only ford
over the Atbara, a clear stream of
tolerable depth, and with lofty banks,
covered with rich grass, with mimosas
and lofty fruit-laden palm-trees. The
next day's march was a severe one&mdash;ten
hours without a halt&mdash;and was
attended, after nightfall, with some
danger, arising partly from the route
lying through trees with barbed
thorns, strong enough to tear the
clothes off men's bodies and the eyes
out of their heads, and partly from the
crowding and pressure in the disorderly
column during its progress
amongst holes and chasms occasioned
by the overflowing of the river. Upon
halting, at midnight, a fire was
lighted for the Bascha, and one of his
attendants brought coffee to Mr
Werne; but he, sick and weary, rejected
it, and would have preferred,
he says, so thoroughly exhausted did
he feel, a nap under a bush to a supper
upon a roasted angel. They were
still ascending the bank of the Atbara,
a winding stream, with wildly beautiful
tree-fringed banks, containing
few fish, but giving shelter, in its
deep places, to the crocodile and hippopotamus.
From the clefts of its
sandstone bed, then partially exposed
by the decline of the waters, sprang
a lovely species of willow, with beautiful
green foliage and white umbelliferous
flowers, having a perfume surpassing
that of jasmine. The Wernes
would gladly, have explored the
neighbourhood; but the tremendous
heat, and a warm wind which played
round their temples with a sickening
effect, drove them into camp. Gunfire
was at noon upon that day; but
it was Mr Werne's turn to be on the
sick-list. Suddenly he felt himself so
ill, that it was with a sort of despairing
horror he saw the tent struck from
over him, loaded upon a camel, and
driven off. In vain he endeavoured
to rise; the sun seemed to dart coals
of fire upon his head. His brother and
servant carried him into the shadow
of a neighbouring palm-tree, and he
sank half-dead upon the glowing sand.
It would suffice to abide there during
the heat of the day, as they thought,
but instead of that, they were compelled
to remain till next morning,
Werne suffering terribly from dysentery.
"Never in my life," he says,
"did I more ardently long for the setting
of the sun than on that day; even
its last rays exercised the same painful
power on my hair, which seemed to
be in a sort of electric connection
with just as many sunbeams, and to
bristle up upon my head. And no
sooner had the luminary which inspired
me with such horror sunk below
the horizon, than I felt myself
better, and was able to get on my
legs and crawl slowly about. Some
good-natured Arab shepherd-lads approached
our fire, pitied me, and
brought me milk and durra-bread.
It was a lovely evening; the full moon
was reflected in the Atbara, as were
also the dark crowns of the palm-trees,
wild geese shrieked around us;
otherwise the stillness was unbroken,
save at intervals by the cooing of
doves. There is something beautiful
in sleeping in the open air, when
weather and climate are suitable.
We awoke before sunrise, comforted,
and got upon our dromedaries; but
after a couple of hours' ride we mistrusted
the sun, and halted with some
wandering Arabs belonging to the
Kabyle of the Kammarabs. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
were hospitably received, and regaled
with milk and bread."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When our two Germans rejoined
headquarters, after four days' absence,
they found Achmet Bascha seated in
the shade upon the ground in front of
his tent, much burned by the sun, and
looking fagged and suffering&mdash;as well
he might be after the heat and exposure
he had voluntarily undergone.
Nothing could cure him, however, at
least as yet, of his fancy for marching
in the heat of the day. Although
obstinate and despotic, the Bascha
was evidently a dashing sort of fellow,
well calculated to win the respect and
admiration of his wild and heterogeneous
army. Weary as were the
two Wernes, (they reached the camp
at noon,) at two o'clock they had to
be again in the saddle. "A number
of gazelles were started; the Bascha
seized a gun and dashed after them
upon his Arabian stallion, almost the
whole of the cavalry scouring after
him like a wild mob, and we ourselves
riding a sharp trot to witness the
chase. We thought he had fallen
from his horse, so suddenly did he
swing himself from saddle to ground,
killing three gazelles with three shots,
of which animals we consumed a considerable
portion roasted for that
night's supper." The river here
widened, and crocodiles showed themselves
upon the opposite shore. The
day was terribly warm; the poor
medico was ill again, suffering grievously
from his head, and complaining
of <em>his hair being so hot</em>; and as the
Salamander Bascha persisted in marching
under a sun which, through the
canvass of the tents, heated sabres
and musket-barrels till it was scarcely
possible to grasp them, the brothers
again lingered behind and followed in
the cool of the evening, Joseph being
mounted upon an easy-going mule
lent him by Topschi Baschi, the good-humoured
but dissolute captain of
the guns. They were now divided
but by the river's breadth from the
hostile tribe of the Haddenda, and
might at any moment be assailed;
so two hours after sunset a halt was
called and numerous camp-fires were
lighted, producing a most picturesque
effect amongst the trees, and by their
illumination of the diversified costumes
of the soldiery, and attracting
a whole regiment of scorpions, "some
of them remarkably fine specimens,"
says Mr Werne, who looks upon these
unpleasant fireside companions with a
scientific eye, "a finger and a half
long, of a light colour, half of the tail
of a brown black and covered with
hair." It is a thousand pities that
the adventurous Mrs Ida Pfeiffer did
not accompany Mr Werne upon this
expedition. She would have had the
finest possible opportunities of curing
herself of the prejudice which it will
be remembered she was so weak as
to entertain against the scorpion
tribe. These pleasant reptiles were
as plentiful all along Mr Werne's line
of march as are cockchafers on a
summer evening in an English oak-copse.
Their visitations were pleasantly
varied by those of snakes of
all sizes, and of various degrees of
venom. "At last," says Mr Werne,
"one gets somewhat indifferent about
scorpions and other wild animals."
He had greater difficulty in accustoming
himself to the sociable habits of
the snakes, who used to glide about
amongst tents and baggage, and by
whom, in the course of the expedition,
a great number of persons were
bitten. On the 12th April "Mohammed
Ladham sent us a remarkable
scorpion&mdash;pity that it is so much
injured&mdash;almost two fingers long,
black-brown, tail and feet covered
with prickly hair, claws as large as
those of a small crab.... We
had laid us down under a green tree
beside a cotton plantation, whilst our
servants unloaded the camels and
pitched the tents, when a snake, six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
feet long, darted from under our carpet,
passed over my leg, and close
before my brother's face. But we
were so exhausted that we lay still,
and some time afterwards the snake
was brought to us, one of Schech
Defalla's people having killed it."
About noon next day a similar snake
sprang out of the said Defalla's own
tent; it was killed also, and found to
measure six feet two inches. The
soldiers perceiving that the German
physician and his brother were curious
in the matter of reptiles, brought
them masses of serpents; but they
had got a notion that the flesh was
the part coveted (not the skin) to
make medicine, and most of the specimens
were so defaced as to be valueless.
Early in May "some soldiers
assured us they had seen in the
thicket a serpent twenty feet long,
and as thick as a man's leg; probably
a species of boa&mdash;a pity that they
could not kill it. The great number
of serpents with dangerous bites
makes our bivouac very unsafe, and
we cannot encamp with any feeling
of security near bushes or amongst
brushwood; the prick of a blade of
straw, the sting of the smallest
insect, causes a hasty movement, for
one immediately fancies it is a snake
or scorpion; and when out shooting,
one's <em>second</em> glance is for the game,
one's <em>first</em> on the ground at his feet,
for fear of trampling and irritating
some venomous reptile." As we proceed
through the volume we shall
come to other accounts of beasts and
reptiles, so remarkable as really
almost to reconcile us to the possibility
of some of the zoological marvels
narrated by the Yankee Doctor
Mayo in his rhapsody of Kaloolah.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
For the present we must revert to
the business of this curiously-conducted
campaign. As the army
advanced, various chiefs presented
themselves, with retinues more or
less numerous. The first of these
was the Grand-Shech Mohammed
Defalla, already named, who came
up, with a great following, on the
28th March. He was a man of
herculean frame; and assuredly such
was very necessary to enable him to
endure in that climate the weight of
his defensive arms. He wore a
double shirt of mail over a quilted
doublet, arm-plates and beautifully
wrought steel gauntlets; his casque
fitted like a shell to the upper part of
his head, and had in front, in lieu of
a visor, an iron bar coming down
over the nose&mdash;behind, for the protection
of the nape, a fringe composed
of small rings. His straight-bladed
sword had a golden hilt. The whole
equipment, which seems to correspond
very closely with that of some
of the Sikhs or other warlike Indian
tribes, proceeded from India, and
Defalla had forty or fifty such suits
of arms. About the same time with
him, arrived two Schechs from the
refractory land of Taka, tall handsome
men; whilst, from the environs
of the neighbouring town of Gos-Rajeb,
a number of people rode out on
dromedaries to meet the Bascha, their
hair quite white with camel-fat, which
melted in the sun and streamed over
their backs. Gos-Rajeb, situated at
about a quarter of a mile from the
left bank of the Atbara, consists of
some two hundred <i>tokul</i> (huts) and
clay-built houses, and in those parts
is considered an important commercial
depot, Indian goods being transported
thither on camels from the
port of Souakim, on the Red Sea.
The inhabitants are of various tribes,
more of them red than black or brown;
but few were visible, many having
fled at the approach of Achmet's
army, which passed the town in imposing
array&mdash;the infantry in double
column in the centre, the Turkish
cavalry on the right, the Schaïgiës and
Mograbins on the left, the artillery,
with kettledrums, cymbals, and other
music, in the van&mdash;marched through
the Atbara, there very shallow, and
encamped on the right bank, in a
stony and almost treeless plain, at
the foot of two rocky hills. The
Bascha ordered the Shech of Gos-Rajeb
to act as guide to the Wernes
in their examination of the vicinity,
and to afford them all the information
in his power. The most remarkable
spot to which he conducted them
was to the site of an ancient city,
which once, according to tradition,
had been as large as Cairo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
inhabited by Christians. The date
of its existence must be very remote,
for the ground was smooth,
and the sole trace of buildings
consisted in a few heaps of broken
bricks. There were indications of a
terrible conflagration, the bricks in
one place being melted together into
a black glazed mass. Mr Werne
could trace nothing satisfactory with
respect to former Christian occupants,
and seems disposed to think that
Burckhardt, who speaks of Christian
monuments at that spot, (in the neighbourhood
of the hill of Herrerem,)
may have been misled by certain
peculiarly formed rocks.</p>

<p>The most renowned chief of the
mutinous tribes of Taka, the conqueror
of the Turks under Churdschid
Bascha, was Mohammed Din, Grand-Schech
of the Haddenda. This personage,
awed by the approach of
Achmet's formidable force, sent his
son to the advancing Bascha, as a
hostage for his loyalty and submission.
Achmet sent the young
man back to his father as bearer
of his commands. The next day
the army crossed the frontier of
Taka, which is not very exactly defined,
left the Atbara in their rear,
and, moving still eastwards, beheld
before them, in the far distance, the
blue mountains of Abyssinia. The
Bascha's suite was now swelled by
the arrival of numerous Schechs, great
and small, with their esquires and attendants.
The route lay through a
thick forest, interwoven with creeping
plants and underwood, and with
thorny mimosas, which grew to a
great height. The path was narrow,
the confusion of the march inconceivably
great and perilous, and if the
enemy had made a vigorous attack
with their javelins, which they are
skilled in throwing, the army must
have endured great loss, with scarcely
a possibility of inflicting any. At last
the scattered column reached an open
space, covered with grass, and intersected
with deep narrow rills of
water. The Bascha, who had outstripped
his troops, was comfortably
encamped, heedless of their fate,
whilst they continued for a long time
to emerge in broken parties from the
wood. Mr Werne's good opinion of
his generalship had been already much
impaired, and this example of true
Turkish indolence, and of the absence
of any sort of military dispositions
under such critical circumstances,
completely destroyed it. The next
day there was some appearance of
establishing camp-guards, and of taking
due precautions against the fierce
and numerous foe, who on former
occasions had thrice defeated Turkish
armies, and from whom an attack might
at any moment be expected. In the
afternoon an alarm was given; the
Bascha, a good soldier, although a
bad general, was in the saddle in an
instant, and gallopping to the spot,
followed by all his cavalry, whilst the
infantry rushed confusedly in the
same direction. The uproar had
arisen, however, not from Arab assailants,
but from some soldiers who
had discovered extensive corn magazines&mdash;<em>silos</em>,
as they are called in Algeria&mdash;holes
in the ground, filled with
grain, and carefully covered over.
By the Bascha's permission, the soldiers
helped themselves from these
abundant granaries, and thus the
army found itself provided with corn
for the next two months. In the
course of the disorderly distribution,
or rather scramble, occurred a little
fight between the Schaïgië, a quarrelsome
set of irregulars, and some of
the Turks. Nothing could be worse
than the discipline of Achmet's host.
The Schaïgiës were active and daring
horsemen, and were the first to draw
blood in the campaign, in a skirmish
upon the following day with some
ambushed Arabs. The neighbouring
woods swarmed with these javelin-bearing
gentry, although they lay
close, and rarely showed themselves,
save when they could inflict injury
at small risk. Mr Werne began to
doubt the possibility of any extensive
or effectual operations against
these wild and wandering tribes,
who, on the approach of the army,
loaded their goods on camels, and
fled into the <i>Chaaba</i>, or forest district,
whither it was impossible to
follow them. Where was the Bascha
to find money and food for the support
of his numerous army?&mdash;where
was he to quarter it during the dangerous
<i>Chariff</i>, or rainy season? He
was very reserved as to his plans;
probably, according to Mr Werne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
because he had none. The Schechs
who had joined and marched with
him could hardly be depended upon,
when it was borne in mind that they,
formerly the independent rulers of a
free people, had been despoiled of
their power and privileges, and were
now the ill-used vassals of the haughty
and stupid Turks, who overwhelmed
them with imposts, treated them contemptuously,
and even subjected them
to the bastinado. "Mohammed Din,
seeing the hard lot of these gentlemen,
seems disposed to preserve his
freedom as long as possible, or to sell
it as dearly as may be. Should it
come to a war, there is, upon our side,
a total want of efficient leaders, at
any rate if we except the Bascha.
Abdin Aga, chief of the Turkish cavalry,
a bloated Arnaut; Sorop Effendi,
a model of stupidity and covetousness;
Hassan Effendi Bimbaschi,
a quiet sot; Soliman Aga, greedy,
and without the slightest education of
any kind; Hassan Effendi of Sennaar,
a Turk in the true sense of the word
(these four are infantry commanders);
Mohammed Ladjam, a good-natured
but inexperienced fellow, chief of the
Mograbin cavalry: amongst all these
officers, the only difference is, that
each is more ignorant than his neighbour.
With such leaders, what can
be expected from an army that, for
the most part, knows no discipline&mdash;the
Schaïgiës, for instance, doing just
what they please, and being in a fair
way to corrupt all the rest&mdash;and that
is encumbered with an endless train
of dangerous rabble, idlers, slaves,
and women of pleasure, serving as
a burthen and hindrance? Let us
console ourselves with the <i>Allah
kerim!</i> (God is merciful.)" Mr
Werne had not long to wait for a
specimen of Turkish military skill.
On the night of the 7th April he was
watching in his tent beside his grievously
sick brother, when there suddenly
arose an uproar in the camp,
followed by firing. "I remained by
our tent, for my brother was scarcely
able to stir, and the infantry also
remained quiet, trusting to their
mounted comrades. But when I saw
Bimbaschi Hassan Effendi lead a
company past us, and madly begin to
fire over the powder-waggons, as if
these were meant to serve as barricades
against the hostile lances, I
ran up to him with my sabre drawn,
and threatened him with the Bascha,
as well as with the weapon, whereupon
he came to his senses, and
begged me not to betray him. The
whole proved to be mere noise, but
the harassed Bascha was again up
and active. He seemed to make no
use of his aides-de-camp, and only
his own presence could inspire his
troops with courage. Some of the
enemy were killed, and there were
many tracks of blood leading into the
wood, although the firing had been at
random in the darkness. As a specimen
of the tactics of our Napoleon-worshipping
Bascha, he allowed the
wells, which were at two hundred
yards from camp, to remain unguarded
at night, so that they might
easily have been filled up by the
enemy. Truly fortunate was it that
there were no great stones in the
neighbourhood to choke them up, for
we were totally without implements
wherewith to have cleared them out
again." Luckily for this most careless
general and helpless army, the
Arabs neglected to profit by their
shortcomings, and on the 14th April,
after many negotiations, the renowned
Mohammed Din himself, awed, we
must suppose, by the numerical
strength of Achmet's troops, and
over-estimating their real value, committed
the fatal blunder of presenting
himself in the Turkish camp. Great
was the curiosity to see this redoubted
chief, who alighted at Schech Defalla's
tent, into which the soldiers impudently
crowded, to get a view of the
man before whom many of them had
formerly trembled and fled. "Mohammed
Din is of middle stature,
and of a black-brown colour, like all
his people; his countenance at first
says little, but, on longer inspection,
its expression is one of great
cunning; his bald head is bare; his
dress Arabian, with drawers of a fiery
red colour. His retinue consists,
without exception, of most ill-looking
fellows, on whose countenances Nature
seems to have done her best to
express the faithless character attributed
to the Haddenda. They are
all above the middle height, and
armed with shields and lances, or
swords." Next morning Mr Werne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
saw the Bascha seated on his <i>angarèb</i>,
(a sort of bedstead, composed of
plaited strips of camel-hide, which,
upon the march, served as a throne,)
with a number of Shechs squatted
upon the ground on either side of
him, amongst them Mohammed Din,
looking humbled, and as if half-repentant
of his rash step. The Bascha
appeared disposed to let him feel that
he was now no better than a caged
lion, whose claws the captor can cut
at will. He showed him, however,
marks of favour, gave him a red
shawl for a turban, and a purple
mantle with gold tassels, but no
sabre, which Mr Werne thought a
bad omen. The Schech was suffered
to go to and fro between the camp
and his own people, but under certain
control&mdash;now with an escort of
Schaïgiës, then leaving his son as
hostage. He sent in some cattle and
sheep as a present, and promised to
bring the tribute due; this he failed
to do, and a time was fixed to him
and the other Shechs within which to
pay up arrears. Notwithstanding the
subjection of their chief, the Arabs
continued their predatory practices,
stealing camels from the camp, or
taking them by force from the grooms
who drove them out to pasture.</p>

<p>Mr Werne's book is a journal,
written daily during the campaign
but, owing to the long interval between
its writing and publication, he
has found it necessary to make frequent
parenthetical additions, corrective
or explanatory. Towards the
end of April, during great sickness in
camp, he writes as follows:&mdash;"My
brother's medical observations and
experiments begin to excite in me a
strong interest. He has promised me
that he will keep a medical journal;
but he must first get into better health,
for now it is always with sickening
disgust that he returns from visiting
his patients; he complains of the insupportable
effluvia from these people,
sinks upon his <i>angarèb</i> with depression
depicted in his features, and falls
asleep with open eyes, so that I often
feel quite uneasy." Then comes the
parenthesis of ten years' later date.
"Subsequently, when I had joined the
expedition for the navigation of the
White Nile, he wrote to me from the
camp of Kàssela-el-Lus to Chartum,
that, with great diligence and industry,
he had written some valuable
papers on African diseases, and was
inconsolable at having lost them. He
had been for ten days dangerously
ill, had missed me sadly, and, in a fit
of delirium, when his servant asked
him for paper to light the fire, had
handed him his manuscript, which the
stupid fellow had forthwith burned.
At the same time, he lamented that,
during his illness, our little menagerie
had been starved to death. The
Bascha had been to see him, and by
his order Topschi Baschi had taken
charge of his money, that he might not
be robbed, giving the servants what
was needful for their keep, and for the
purchase of flesh for the animals. The
servants had drunk the money intended
for the beasts' food. When my
brother recovered his health, he had
the <em>fagged</em>, (a sort of lynx,) which had
held out longest, and was only just
dead, cut open, and so convinced himself
that it had died of hunger. The
annoyance one has to endure from
these people is beyond conception,
and the very mildest-tempered man&mdash;as,
for instance, my late brother&mdash;is
compelled at times to make use of the
whip."</p>

<p>Whilst Mohammed Din and the
other Shechs, accompanied by detachments
of Turkish troops, intended
partly to support them in their demands,
and partly to reconnoitre the
country, endeavoured to get together
the stipulated tribute, the army remained
stationary. But repose did
not entail monotony; strange incidents
were of daily occurrence in this singular
camp. The Wernes, always
anxious for the increase of their cabinet
of stuffed birds and beasts, sent
their huntsman Abdallah with one of
the detachments, remaining themselves,
for the present at least, at headquarters,
to collect whatever might
come in their way. The commander
of the Mograbins sent them an antelope
as big as a donkey, having legs
like a cow, and black twisted horns.
From the natives little was to be
obtained. They were very shy and
ill-disposed, and could not be prevailed
upon, even by tenfold payment,
to supply the things most abundant
with them, as for instance milk and
honey. In hopes of alluring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
conciliating them, the Bascha ordered
those traders who had accompanied
the army to establish a bazaar outside
the fence enclosing the camp. The
little mirrors that were there sold
proved a great attraction. The Arabs
would sit for whole days looking in
them, and pulling faces. But no
amount of reflection could render them
amicable or honest: they continued to
steal camels and asses whenever they
could, and one of them caught a
Schaigie's horse, led him up to the
camp, and stabbed him to death. So
great was the hatred of these tribes to
their oppressors&mdash;a hatred which
would have shown itself by graver
aggressions, but for Achmet's large
force, and above all, for their dread
of firearms. Within the camp there
was wild work enough at times. The
good-hearted, hot-headed Werne was
horribly scandalised by the ill-treatment
of the slaves. Dumont, the
French apothecary, had a poor lad
named Amber, a mere boy, willing
and industrious, whom he continually
beat and kicked, until at last Mr
Werne challenged him to a duel with
sabres, and threatened to take away
the slave, which he, as a Frenchman,
had no legal right to possess. But
this was nothing compared to the
cruelties practised by other Europeans,
and especially at Chartum by
one Vigoureux, (a French corporal
who had served under Napoleon, and
was now adjutant of an Egyptian
battalion,) and his wife, upon a poor
black girl, only ten years of age,
whom they first barbarously flogged,
and then tied to a post, with her
bleeding back exposed to the broiling
sun. Informed of this atrocity by his
brother, who had witnessed it, Mr
Werne sprang from his sickbed, and
flew to the rescue, armed with his
sabre, and with a well-known iron
stick, ten pounds in weight, which
had earned him the nickname of Abu-Nabut,
or Father of the Stick. A
distant view of his incensed countenance
sufficed, and the Frenchman,
cowardly as cruel, hastened to release
his victim, and to humble himself
before her humane champion. Concerning
this corporal and his dame,
whom he had been to France to fetch,
and who was brought to bed on camel-back,
under a burning sun, in the
midst of the desert, some curious
reminiscences are set down in the
<cite>Feldzug</cite>, as are also some diverting
details of the improprieties of the dissipated
gunner Topschi Baschi, who,
on the 1st May, brought dancing-girls
into the hut occupied by the two
Germans, and assembled a mob round
it by the indecorous nature of his
proceedings. Regulations for the internal
order and security of the camp
were unheard of. After a time, tents
were pitched over the ammunition; a
ditch was dug around it, and strict
orders were given to light no fire in its
vicinity. All fires, too, by command
of the Bascha, were to be extinguished
when the evening gun was fired. For
a short time the orders were obeyed;
then they were forgotten; fires were
seen blazing late at night, and within
fifteen paces of the powder. Nothing
but the bastinado could give memory
to these reckless fatalists. "I have
often met ships upon the Nile, so laden
with straw that there was scarcely
room for the sailors to work the vessel.
No matter for that; in the midst of
the straw a mighty kitchen-fire was
merrily blazing."</p>

<p>On the 6th of May, the two Wernes
mounted their dromedaries and set off,
attended by one servant, and with a
guide provided by Mohammed Defalla,
for the village of El Soffra, at a distance
of two and a half leagues, where
they expected to find Mohammed Din
and a large assemblage of his tribe.
It was rather a daring thing to advance
thus unescorted into the land
of the treacherous Haddendas, and the
Bascha gave his consent unwillingly;
but Mussa, (Moses,) the Din's only
son, was hostage in the camp, and
they deemed themselves safer alone
than with the half company of soldiers
Achmet wanted to send with them.
Their route lay due east, at first through
fields of <i>durra</i>, (a sort of grain,)
afterwards through forests of saplings.
The natives they met greeted
them courteously, and they reached
El Soffra without molestation, but
there learned, to their considerable
annoyance, that Mohammed Din
had gone two leagues and a half
farther, to the camp of his nephew
Shech Mussa, at Mitkenàb. So, after
a short pause, they again mounted
their camels, and rode off, loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
maledictions by the Arabs, because
they would not remain and supply
them with medicine, although the same
Arabs refused to requite the drugs
with so much as a cup of milk. They
rode for more than half an hour before
emerging from the straggling village,
which was composed of wretched huts
made of palm-mats, having an earthen
cooking-vessel, a leathern water-bottle,
and two stones for bruising corn,
for sole furniture. The scanty dress
of the people&mdash;some of the men had
nothing but a leathern apron round
their hips, and a sheep-skin, with the
wool inwards, over their shoulders&mdash;their
long hair and wild countenances,
gave them the appearance of thorough
savages. In the middle of every village
was an open place, where the
children played stark naked in the
burning sun, their colour and their
extraordinarily nimble movements
combining, says Mr Werne, to give
them the appearance of a troop of
young imps. Infants, which in Europe
would lie helpless in the cradle, are
there seen rolling in the sand, with none
to mind them, and playing with the
young goats and other domestic
animals. In that torrid climate, the
development of the human frame is
wonderfully rapid. Those women of
whom the travellers caught a sight in
this large village, which consisted of
upwards of two thousand huts and
tents, were nearly all old and ugly.
The young ones, when they by chance
encountered the strangers, covered
their faces, and ran away. On the
road to Mitkenàb, however, some
young and rather handsome girls
showed themselves. "They all looked
at us with great wonder," says Mr
Werne, "and took us for Turks, for
we are the first Franks who have come
into this country."</p>

<p>Mitkenàb, pleasantly situated
amongst lofty trees, seemed to invite
the wanderers to cool shelter from
the mid-day sun. They were parched
with thirst when they entered it, but
not one of the inquisitive Arabs who
crowded around them would attend to
their request for a draught of milk or
water. Here, however, was Mohammed
Din, and with him a party of
Schaïgiës under Melek Mahmud,
whom they found encamped under a
great old tree, with his fifty horsemen
around him. After they had
taken some refreshment, the Din
came to pay them a visit. He refused
to take the place offered him on an
<i>angarèb</i>, but sat down upon the
ground, giving them to understand,
with a sneering smile, that <em>that</em>
was now the proper place for him.
"We had excellent opportunity to
examine the physiognomy of this
Schech, who is venerated like a
demigod by all the Arabs between
the Atbara and the Red Sea. 'He
is a brave man,' they say, 'full of
courage; there is no other like him!'
His face is fat and round, with small
grey-brown, piercing, treacherous-looking
eyes, expressing both the
cunning and the obstinacy of his
character; his nose is well-proportioned
and slightly flattened; his
small mouth constantly wears a
satirical scornful smile. But for this
expression and his thievish glance,
his bald crown and well-fed middle-sized
person would become a monk's
hood. He goes with his head bare,
wears a white cotton shirt and <em>ferda</em>,
and sandals on his feet.... We
told him that he was well known to
the Franks as a great hero; he shook
his head and said that on the salt
lake, at Souakim, he had seen great
ships with cannon, but that he did
not wish the help of the Inglèb (English;)
then he said something else,
which was not translated to us. I
incautiously asked him, how numerous
his nation was. 'Count the trees,'
he replied, glancing ironically around
him; (a poll-tax constituted a portion
of the tribute.) Conversation through
an interpreter was so wearisome that
we soon took our leave." At Mitkenàb
they were upon the borders of
the great forest (Chaaba) that extends
from the banks of the Atbara to the
shores of the Red Sea. It contains
comparatively few lofty trees&mdash;most
of these getting uprooted by hurricanes,
when the rainy season has
softened the ground round their roots&mdash;but
a vast deal of thicket and dense
brushwood, affording shelter to legions
of wild beasts; innumerable herds of
elephants, rhinoceroses, lions, tigers,
giraffes, various inferior beasts, and
multitudes of serpents of the most
venomous description. For fear of
these unpleasant neighbours, no Arab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
at Mitkenàb quits his dwelling after
nightfall. "When we returned to
the wells, a little before sundown, we
found all the Schaïgiës on the move,
to take up their quarters in an enclosure
outside the village, partly on
account of the beasts of prey, especially
the lions, which come down to
drink of a night, partly for safety
from the unfriendly Arabs. We went
with them and encamped with Mammud
in the middle of the enclosure.
We slept soundly the night through,
only once aroused by the hoarse cries
of the hyenas, which were sneaking
about the village, setting all the
dogs barking. To insure our safety,
Mohammed Din himself slept at our
door&mdash;so well-disposed were his
people towards us." A rumour had
gained credit amongst the Arabs, that
the two mysterious strangers were,
sent by Achmet to reconnoitre the
country for the Bascha's own advance;
and so incensed were they at this,
that, although their beloved chief's
son was a hostage in the Turkish
camp, it was only by taking bypaths,
under guidance of a young
relative of Schech Mussa's, that the
Wernes were able to regain their
camp in safety. A few days after
their return they were both attacked
by bad fever, which for some time
prevented them from writing. They
lost their reckoning, and thenceforward
the journal is continued without
dates.</p>

<p>The Bascha grew weary of life in
camp, and pined after action. In vain
did the Schaïgiës toss the djereed, and
go through irregular tournaments and
sham fights for his diversion; in vain
did he rattle the dice with Topschi
Baschi; vain were the blandishments
of an Abyssinian beauty whom he
had quartered in a hut surrounded
with a high fence, and for whose
amusement he not unfrequently had
nocturnal serenades performed by the
band of the 8th regiment; to which
brassy and inharmonious challenge
the six thousand donkeys assembled
in camp never failed to respond by an
ear-splitting bray, whilst the numerous
camels bellowed a bass: despite all
these amusements, the Bascha suffered
from ennui. He was furious when
he saw how slowly and scantily came
in the tribute for which he had made
this long halt. Some three hundred
cows were all that had yet been delivered;
a ridiculously small number
contrasted with the vast herds possessed
by those tribes. Achmet foamed
with rage at this ungrateful return
for his patience and consideration.
He reproached the Schechs who were
with him, and sent for Mohammed
Din, Shech Mussa, and the two
Shechs of Mitkenàb. Although their
people, foreboding evil, endeavoured to
dissuade them from obedience, they
all four came and were forthwith put
in irons and chained together. With
all his cunning Mohammed Din had
fallen into the snare. His plan had
been, so Mr Werne believes, to cajole
and detain the Turks by fair words
and promises until the rainy season,
when hunger and sickness would have
proved his best allies. The Bascha
had been beforehand with him, and
the old marauder might now repent at
leisure that he had not trusted to his
impenetrable forests and to the javelins
of his people, rather than to the word
of a Turk. On the day of his arrest
the usual evening gun was loaded
with canister, and fired into the
woods in the direction of the Haddendas,
the sound of cannon inspiring
the Arab and negro tribes with a
panic fear. Firearms&mdash;to them incomprehensible
weapons&mdash;have served
more than anything else to daunt
their courage. "When the Turks
attacked a large and populous mountain
near Faszogl, the blacks sent out
spies to see how strong was the foe,
and how armed. The spies came
back laughing, and reported that
there was no great number of men;
that their sole arms were shining sticks
upon their shoulders, and that they
had neither swords, lances, nor shields.
The poor fellows soon found how
terrible an effect had the sticks they
deemed so harmless. As they could
not understand how it was that small
pieces of lead should wound and kill,
a belief got abroad amongst them,
that the Afrite, Scheitàn, (the devil or
evil spirit,) dwelt in the musket-barrels.
With this conviction, a
negro, grasping a soldier's musket,
put his hand over the mouth of the
barrel, that the afrite might not get
out. The soldier pulled the trigger,
and the leaden devil pierced the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
black's hand and breast. After an
action, a negro collected the muskets
of six or seven slain soldiers, and joyfully
carried them home, there to
forge them into lances in the presence
of a party of his friends. But it
happened that some of them were
loaded, and soon getting heated in
the fire, they went off, scattering
death and destruction around them."
Most of the people in Taka run from
the mere report of a musket, but the
Arabs of Hedjàs, a mountainous
district near the Red Sea, possess
firearms, and are slow but very good
shots.</p>

<p>In the way of tribute, nothing was
gained by the imprisonment of Mahommed
Din and his companions.
No more contributions came in, and
not an Arab showed himself upon
the market-place outside the camp.
Mohammed Din asked why his captors
did not kill rather than confine
him; he preferred death to captivity,
and keeping him prisoner would lead,
he said, to no result. The Arab
chiefs in camp did not conceal their
disgust at the Bascha's treatment of
their Grand-Shech, and taxed Achmet
with having broken his word, since
he had given him the Amàhn&mdash;promise
of pardon. Any possibility of
conciliating the Arabs was destroyed
by the step that had been taken. At
night they swarmed round the camp,
shrieking their war-cry. The utmost
vigilance was necessary; a third of
the infantry was under arms all night,
the consequent fatigue increasing the
amount of sickness. The general
aspect of things was anything but
cheering. The Wernes had their
private causes of annoyance. Six of
their camels, including the two excellent
dromedaries given to them by the
Bascha before quitting Chartum, were
stolen whilst their camel-driver slept,
and could not be recovered. They
were compelled to buy others, and
Mr Werne complains bitterly of the
heavy expenses of the campaign&mdash;expenses
greatly augmented by the
sloth and dishonesty of their servants.
The camel-driver, fearing to face his
justly-incensed employers, disappeared
and was no more heard of. Upon
this and other occasions, Mr Werne
was struck by the extraordinary skill
of the Turks in tracing animals and
men by their footsteps. In this manner
his servants tracked his camels to an
Arab village, although the road had
been trampled by hundreds of beasts
of the same sort. "If these people
have once seen the footprint of a man,
camel, horse, or ass, they are sure to
recognise it amongst thousands of
such impressions, and will follow the
trail any distance, so long as the
ground is tolerably favourable, and
wind or rain has not obliterated the
marks. In cases of loss, people send
for a man who makes this kind of
search his profession; they show him
a footprint of the lost animal, and
immediately, without asking any
other indication, he follows the track
through the streets of a town, daily
trodden by thousands, and seldom
falls to hunt out the game. He does
not proceed slowly, or stoop to examine
the ground, but his sharp eye
follows the trail at a run. We ourselves
saw the footstep of a runaway
slave shown to one of these men, who
caught the fugitive at the distance of
three days' journey from that spot.
My brother once went out of the
Bascha's house at Chartum, to visit a
patient who lived far off in the town.
He had been gone an hour when the
Bascha desired to see him, and the
tschansch (orderly) traced him at
once by his footmarks on the unpaved
streets in which crowds had left
similar signs. When, in consequence
of my sickness, we lingered for some
days on the Atbara, and then marched
to overtake the army, the Schaïgiës
who escorted us detected, amidst the
hoof-marks of the seven or eight
thousand donkeys accompanying the
troops, those of a particular jackass
belonging to one of their friends, and
the event proved that they were
right." Mr Werne fills his journal,
during his long sojourn in camp, with
a great deal of curious information
concerning the habits and peculiarities
of both Turks and Arabs, as well as
with the interesting results of his
observations on the brute creation.
The soldiers continued to bring to
him and his brother all manner of
animals and reptiles&mdash;frogs, whole
coils of snakes, and chameleons, which
there abound, but whose changes of
colour Mr Werne found to be much less
numerous than is commonly believed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
For two months he watched the
variations of hue of these curious
lizards, and found them limited to
different shades of grey and green,
with yellow stripes and spots. He
made a great pet of a young wild cat,
which was perfectly tame, and extraordinarily
handsome. Its colour was
grey, beautifully spotted with black,
like a panther; its head was smaller
and more pointed than that of European
cats; its ears, of unusual size,
were black, with white stripes.
Many of the people in camp took it
to be a young tiger, but the natives
called it a <em>fagged</em>, and said it was a
sort of cat, in which Mr Werne
agreed with them. "Its companion
and playfellow is a rat, about the
size of a squirrel, with a long silvery
tail, which, when angry, it swells out,
and sets up over its back. This poor
little beast was brought to us with
two broken legs, and we gave it to
the cat, thinking it was near death.
But the cat, not recognising her
natural prey&mdash;and moreover feeling
the want of a companion&mdash;and the
rat, tamed by pain and cured by
splints, became inseparable friends,
ate together, and slept arm in arm.
The rat, which was not ugly like our
house rats, but was rather to be considered
handsome, by reason of its
long frizzled tail, never made use of
its liberty to escape." Notwithstanding
the numerous devices put in practice
by the Wernes to pass their
time, it at last began to hang heavy,
and their pipes were almost their sole
resource and consolation. Smoking
is little customary in Egypt, except
amongst the Turks and Arabs. The
Mograbins prefer chewing. The blacks
of the Gesira make a concentrated
infusion of this weed, which they call
<em>bucca</em>; take a mouthful of it, and roll
the savoury liquor round their teeth
for a quarter of an hour before ejecting
it. They are so addicted to this
practice, that they invite their friends
to "bucca" as Europeans do to
dinner. The vessel containing the
tobacco juice makes the round of the
party, and a profound silence ensues,
broken only by the harmonious gurgle
of the delectable fluid. Conversation
is carried on by signs.</p>

<p>"We shall march to-morrow," had
long been the daily assurance of those
wiseacres, to be found in every army,
who always know what the general
means to do better than the general
himself. At last the much-desired
order was issued&mdash;of course when
everybody least expected it&mdash;and,
after a night of bustle and confusion,
the army got into motion, in its usual
disorderly array. Its destination was
a mountain called Kassela-el-Lus, in
the heart of the Taka country, whither
the Bascha had sent stores of grain,
and where he proposed passing the
rainy season and founding a new
town. The distance was about fourteen
hours' march. The route led
south-eastwards, at first through a
level country, covered with boundless
fields of tall <em>durra</em>. At the horizon,
like a great blue cloud, rose the
mountain of Kassela, a blessed sight
to eyes that had long been weary of
the monotonous level country. After
a while the army got out of the durra-fields,
and proceeded over a large
plain scantily overgrown with grass,
observing a certain degree of military
order and discipline, in anticipation
of an attempt, on the part of the
angry Arabs, to rescue Mohammed
Din and his companions in captivity.
Numerous hares and jackals were
started and ridden down. Even
gazelles, swift as they are, were sometimes
overtaken by the excellent
Turkish horses. Presently the grass
grew thicker and tall enough to conceal
a small donkey, and they came
to wooded tracts and jungles, and
upon marks of elephants and other
wild beasts. The foot-prints of the
elephants, in places where the ground
had been slightly softened by the
rain, were often a foot deep, and from
a foot and a half to two feet in length
and breadth. Mr Werne regrets not
obtaining a view of one of these giant
brutes. The two-horned rhinoceros
is also common in that region, and is
said to be of extraordinary ferocity
in its attacks upon men and beasts,
and not unfrequently to come off conqueror
in single combat with the elephant.
"Suddenly the little Schaïgiës
cavalry set up a great shouting, and
every one handled his arms, anticipating
an attack from the Arabs.
But soon the cry of 'Asset! Asset!'
(lion) was heard, and we gazed eagerly
on every side, curious for the lion's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
appearance. The Bascha had already
warned his chase-loving cavalry,
under penalty of a thousand blows, not
to quit their ranks on the appearance
of wild beasts, for in that broken
ground he feared disorder in the army
and an attack from the enemy. I
and my brother were at that moment
with Melek Mahmud at the outward
extremity of the left wing; suddenly
a tolerably large lioness trotted out of
a thicket beside us, not a hundred
paces off. She seemed quite fearless,
for she did not quicken her pace at
sight of the army. The next minute
a monstrous lion showed himself at
the same spot, roaring frightfully, and
apparently in great fury; his motions
were still slower than those of his
female; now and then he stood still
to look at us, and after coming to
within sixty or seventy paces&mdash;we all
standing with our guns cocked, ready
to receive him&mdash;he gave us a parting
scowl, and darted away, with great
bounds, in the track of his wife. In
a moment both had disappeared."
Soon after this encounter, which
startled and delighted Dr Werne, and
made his brother's little dromedary
dance with alarm, they reached the
banks of the great <i>gohr</i>, (the bed of
a river, filled only in the rainy season,)
known as El Gasch, which
intersects the countries of Taka and
Basa. With very little daring and
still less risk, the Haddendas, who
are said to muster eighty thousand
fighting men, might have annihilated
the Bascha's army, as it wound its
toilsome way for nearly a league
along the dry water-course, (whose
high banks were crowned with trees
and thick bushes,) the camels stumbling
and occasionally breaking their
legs in the deep holes left by the feet
of the elephants, where the cavalry
could not have acted, and where
every javelin must have told upon
the disorderly groups of weary infantry.
The Arabs either feared the
firearms, or dreaded lest their attack
should be the signal for the
instant slaughter of their Grand-Shech,
who rode, in the midst of the
infantry, upon a donkey, which had
been given him out of consideration
for his age, whilst the three other
prisoners were cruelly forced to perform
the whole march on foot, with
heavy chains on their necks and feet,
and exposed to the jibes of the
pitiless soldiery. On quitting the
Gohr, the march was through trees
and brushwood, and then through a
sort of labyrinthine swamp, where
horses and camels stumbled at every
step, and where the Arabs again had
a glorious opportunity, which they
again neglected, of giving Achmet
such a lesson as they had given to his
predecessor in the Baschalik. The
army now entered the country of the
Hallengas, and a six days' halt succeeded
to their long and painful
march.</p>

<p>It would be of very little interest
to trace the military operations of
Achmet Bascha, which were altogether
of the most contemptible
description&mdash;consisting in the <i>chasuas</i>,
or razzias already noticed, sudden
and secret expeditions of bodies of
armed men against defenceless tribes,
whom they despoiled of their cattle
and women. From his camp at the
foot of Kassela-el-Lus, the Bascha
directed many of these marauding
parties, remaining himself safely in a
large hut, which Mr Werne had had
constructed for him, and usually
cheating the men and officers, who had
borne the fatigue and run the risk,
out of their promised share of the
booty. Sometimes the unfortunate
natives, driven to the wall and rendered
desperate by the cruelties of
their oppressors, found courage for a
stout resistance.</p>

<p>"An expedition took place to the
mountains of Basa, and the troops
brought back a large number of
prisoners of both sexes. The men
were almost all wounded, and showed
great fortitude under the painful
operation of extracting the balls.
Even the Turks confessed that these
mountaineers had made a gallant
defence with lances and stones. Of
our soldiers several had musket-shot
wounds, inflicted by their comrades'
disorderly fire. The Turks asserted
that the Mograbins and Schaïgiës
sometimes fired intentionally at the
soldiers, to drive them from their
booty. It was a piteous sight to see
the prisoners&mdash;especially the women
and children&mdash;brought into camp
bound upon camels, and with despair
in their countenances. Before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
were sold or allotted, they were taken
near the tent of Topschi Baschi,
where a fire was kept burning, and
were all, even to the smallest children,
branded on the shoulder with a red-hot
iron in the form of a star.
When their moans and lamentations
reached our hut, we took our
guns and hastened away out shooting
with three servants. These, notwithstanding
our exhortations, would
ramble from us, and we had got
exceedingly angry with them for so
doing, when suddenly we heard three
shots, and proceeded in that direction,
thinking it was they who had
fired. Instead of them, we found
three soldiers, lying upon the
ground, bathed in their blood and
terribly torn. Two were already
dead, and the third, whose whole
belly was ripped up, told us they had
been attacked by a lion. The three
shots brought up our servants, whom
we made carry the survivor into camp,
although my brother entertained
slight hopes of saving him. The
Bascha no sooner heard of the incident
than he got on horseback with
Soliman Kaschef and his people, to
hunt the lion, and I accompanied him
with my huntsman Sale, a bold fellow,
who afterwards went with me up the
White Nile. On reaching the spot
where the lion had been, the Turks
galloped off to seek him, and I and
Sale alone remained behind. Suddenly
I heard a heavy trampling, and
a crashing amongst the bushes, and I
saw close beside me an elephant with
its calf. Sale, who was at some distance,
and had just shot a parrot,
called out to know if he should fire at
the elephant, which I loudly forbade
him to do. The beast broke its way
through the brushwood just at hand.
I saw its high back, and took up a
safe position amongst several palm-trees,
which all grew from one root,
and were so close together that the
elephant could not get at me. Sale
was already up a tree, and told me
the elephant had turned round, and
was going back into the chaaba. The
brute seemed angry or anxious about
its young one, for we found the
ground dug up for a long distance by
its tusk as by a plough. Some shots
were fired, and we thought the Bascha
and his horsemen were on the track
of the lion, but they had seen the elephant,
and formed a circle round it.
A messenger galloped into camp,
and in a twinkling the Arnaut Abdin
Bey came up with part of his people.
The elephant, assailed on all sides by
a rain of bullets, charged first one
horseman, then another; they delivered
their fire and galloped off.
The eyes were the point chiefly aimed
at, and it soon was evident that he
was blinded by the bullets, for when
pursuing his foes he ran against the
trees, the shock of his unwieldy mass
shaking the fruit from the palms.
The horsemen dismounted and
formed a smaller circle around him.
He must already have received some
hundred bullets, and the ground over
which he staggered was dyed red,
when the Bascha crept quite near
him, knelt down and sent a shot into
his left eye, whereupon the colossus
sank down upon his hinder end and
died. Nothing was to be seen of the
calf or of the lion, but a few days
later a large male lion was killed by
Soliman Kaschef's men, close to camp,
where we often in the night-time
heard the roaring of those brutes."</p>

<p>Just about this time bad news
reached the Wernes. Their huntsman
Abdallah, to whom they were
much attached by reason of his gallantry
and fidelity, had gone a long
time before to the country of the Beni-Amers,
eastward from Taka, in company
of a Schaïgië chief, mounted
on one of their best camels, armed
with a double-barrelled gun, and provided
with a considerable sum of
money for the purchase of giraffes.
On his way back to his employers,
with a valuable collection of stuffed
birds and other curiosities, he was
barbarously murdered, when travelling,
unescorted, through the Hallenga
country, and plundered of all his baggage.
Sale, who went to identify his
friend's mutilated corpse, attributed
the crime to the Hallengas. Mr
Werne was disposed to suspect Mohammed
Ehle, a great villain, whom
the Bascha at times employed as a
secret stabber and assassin. This
Ehle had been appointed Schech of
the Hallengas by the Divan, in lieu
of the rightful Schech, who had refused
submission to the Turks. Three
nephews of Mohammed Din (one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
them the same youth who had escorted
the Wernes safely back to camp
when they were in peril of their
lives in the Haddenda country) came
to visit their unfortunate relative, who
was still a prisoner, cruelly treated,
lying upon the damp earth, chained to
two posts, and awaiting with fortitude
the cruel death by impalement with
which the Bascha threatened him.
Achmet received the young men very
coldly, and towards evening they set
out, greatly depressed by their uncle's
sad condition, upon their return homewards.
Early next morning the
Wernes, when out shooting, found
the dead bodies of their three friends.
They had been set upon and slain
after a gallant defence, as was testified
by their bloody lances, and by
other signs of a severe struggle. The
birds of prey had already picked out
their eyes, and their corpses presented
a frightful spectacle. The Wernes,
convinced that this assassination had
taken place by the Bascha's order,
loaded the bodies on a camel, took
them to Achmet, and preferred an
accusation against the Hallengas for
this shameful breach of hospitality.
The Bascha's indifference confirmed
their suspicions. He testified no indignation,
but there was great excitement
amongst his officers; and when
they left the Divan, Mr Werne violently
reproached Mohammed Ehle,
whom he was well assured was the
murderer, and who endured his anger
in silence. "The Albanian Abdin
Bey was so enraged that he was only
withheld by the united persuasions of
the other officers from mounting his
horse and charging Mohammed Ehle
with his wild Albanians, the consequence
of which would inevitably
have been a general mutiny against
the Bascha, for the soldiers had long
been murmuring at their bad food and
ill treatment." The last hundred
pages of Mr Werne's very closely
printed and compendious volume
abound in instances of the Bascha's
treachery and cruelty, and of the retaliation
exercised by the Arabs. On
one occasion a party of fifty Turkish
cavalry were murdered by the Haddendas,
who had invited them to a
feast. The town of Gos-Rajeb was
burned, twenty of the merchants there
resident were killed, and the corn,
stored there for the use of the army
on its homeward march, was plundered.
The Bascha had a long-cherished
plan of cutting off the supply of
water from the country of the
Haddendas. This was to be done by
damming up the Gohr-el-Gasch, and
diverting the abundant stream which,
in the rainy season, rushed along its
deep gully, overflowing the tall
banks and fertilising fields and forests.
As the Bascha's engineer and confidential
adviser, Mr Werne was
compelled to direct this work. By the
labour of thousands of men, extensive
embankments were made, and the
Haddendas began to feel the want of
water, which had come down from
the Abyssinian mountains, and already
stood eight feet deep in the
Gohr. Mr Werne repented his share
in the cruel work, and purposely
abstained from pressing the formation
of a canal which was to carry off the
superfluous water to the Atbara, there
about three leagues distant from the
Gohr. And one morning he was
awakened by a great uproar in the
camp, and by the shouts of the Bascha,
who was on horseback before his
hut, and he found that a party of Haddendas
had thrashed a picket and
made an opening in the dykes, which
was the deathblow to Achmet's magnificent
project of extracting an exorbitant
tribute from Mohammed Din's
tribe as the price of the supply of
water essential to their very existence.
The sole results of the cruel
attempt were a fever to the Bascha,
who had got wet, and the sickness of
half the army, who had been compelled
to work like galley-slaves under
a burning sun and upon bad rations.
The vicinity of Kassela is rich in
curious birds and beasts. The mountain
itself swarms with apes, and Mr
Werne frequently saw groups of two
or three hundred of them seated upon
the cliffs. They are about the size
of a large dog, with dark brown hair
and hideous countenances. Awful
was the screaming and howling they
set up of a night, when they received
the unwelcome visit of some hungry
leopard or prowling panther. Once
the Wernes went out with their guns
for a day's sport amongst the monkeys,
but were soon glad to beat a retreat
under a tremendous shower of stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Hassan, a Turk, who purveyed the
brothers with hares, gazelles, and
other savoury morsels, and who was
a very good shot, promised to bring
in&mdash;of course for good payment&mdash;not
only a male and female monkey, but
a whole camel-load if desired. He
started off with this object, but did
not again show himself for some days,
and tried to sneak out of the Wernes'
way when they at last met him in the
bazaar. He had a hole in his head,
and his shoulder badly hurt, and declared
he would have nothing more
to say to those <em>transformed men</em> upon
the mountain. Mr Werne was very
desirous to catch a monkey alive, but
was unsuccessful, and Mohammed
Ehle refused to sell a tame one which
he owned, and which usually sat upon
his hut. Mr Werne thinks them a
variety of the Chimpanzee. They
fight amongst themselves with sticks,
and defend themselves fiercely with
stones against the attacks of men.
Upon the whole the Wernes were
highly fortunate in collecting zoological
and ornithological specimens, of
which they subsequently sent a large
number, stuffed, to the Berlin museum.
They also secured several birds and
animals alive; amongst these a young
lion and a civet cat. Regarding reptiles
they were very curious, and nothing of
that kind was too long or too large
for them. As Ferdinand Werne was
sitting one day upon his dromedary, in
company with the Bascha, on the left
bank of the Gasch, the animals shied
at a large serpent which suddenly
darted by. The Bascha ordered the
men who were working at the dykes
to capture it, which they at once proceeded
to do, as unconcernedly as an
English haymaker would assail a
hedge snake. "Pursued by several
men, the serpent plunged into the
water, out of which it then boldly
reared its head, and confronted an
Arab who had jumped in after it,
armed with a <i>hassaie</i>. With extraordinary
skill and daring the Arab
approached it, his club uplifted, and
struck it over the head, so that the
serpent fell down stunned and writhing
mightily; whereupon another
Arab came up with a cord; the club-bearer,
without further ceremony,
griped the reptile by the throat, just
below the head; the noose was made
fast, and the pair of them dragged
their prize on shore. There it lay for
a moment motionless, and we contemplated
the terribly beautiful creature,
which was more than eleven
feet long and half-a-foot in diameter.
But when they began to drag it away,
by which the skin would of course be
completely spoiled, orders were given
to <em>carry</em> it to camp. A jacket was
tied over its head, and three men set
to work to get it upon their shoulders;
but the serpent made such violent
convulsive movements that all three
fell to the ground with it, and the
same thing occurred again when
several others had gone to their
assistance. I accompanied them into
camp, drove a big nail into the foremost
great beam of our <i>recuba</i>, (hut,)
and had the monster suspended from
it. He hung down quite limp, as did
also several other snakes, which were
still alive, and which our servants had
suspended inside our hut, intending
to skin them the next morning, as
it was now nearly dark. In the
night I felt a most uncomfortable
sensation. One of the snakes, which
was hung up at the head of my
bed, had smeared his cold tail over
my face. But I sprang to my feet in
real alarm, and thought I had been
struck over the shin with a club, when
the big serpent, now in the death
agony, gave me a wipe with its tail
through the open door, in front of
which our servants were squatted,
telling each other ghost stories of
snake-kings and the like....
They called this serpent <i>assala</i>, which,
however, is a name they give to all
large serpents. Soon afterwards we
caught another, as thick, but only
nine feet long, and with a short tail,
like the <i>Vipera cerastes</i>; and this was
said to be of that breed of short, thick
snakes which can devour a man." In
the mountains of Basa, two days'
journey from the Gohr-el-Gasch, and
on the road thither, snakes are said
to exist, of no great length, but as
thick as a crocodile, and which can
conveniently swallow a man; and
instances were related to Mr Werne
of these monsters having swallowed
persons when they lay sleeping on
their angarèbs. Sometimes the victims
had been rescued <em>when only half
gorged</em>! Of course travellers hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
strange stories, and some of those
related by Mr Werne are tolerably
astounding; but these are derived
from his Turkish, Egyptian, or Arabian
acquaintances, and there is no
appearance of exaggeration or romancing
in anything which he narrates as
having occurred to or been witnessed
by himself. A wild tradition was
told him of a country called Bellad-el-Kelb,
which signifies the Country
of Dogs, where the women were in all
respects human, but where the men
had faces like dogs, claws on their feet,
and tails like monkeys. They could
not speak, but carried on conversation
by wagging their tails. This ludicrous
account appeared explicable by
the fact, that the men of Bellad-el-Kelb
are great robbers, living by
plunder, and, like fierce and hungry
dogs, never relinquishing their prey.</p>

<p>The Hallengas, amongst whom the
expedition now found itself, were far
more frank and friendly, and much
less wild, than the Haddendas and
some other tribes, and they might
probably have been converted into
useful allies by a less cruel and capricious
invader than the Bascha. But
conciliation was no part of his scheme;
if he one day caressed a tribe or a
chief, it was only to betray them the
next. Mr Werne was on good terms
with some of the Hallenga sheiks, and
went to visit the village of Hauathi,
about three miles from camp, to see
the birds of paradise which abounded
there. On his road he saw from afar
a great tree covered with those beautiful
birds, and which glistened in the
sunshine with all the colours of the
rainbow. Some days later he and
his brother went to drink <i>merissa</i>, a
slightly intoxicating liquor, with one
of the Fakis or priests of the country.
The two Germans got very jovial,
drinking to each other, student-fashion;
and the faki, attempting to
keep pace with them, got crying-drunk,
and disclosed a well-matured
plan for blowing up their powder-magazine.
The ammunition had been
stored in the village of Kadmin, which
was a holy village, entirely inhabited
by fakis. The Bascha had made sure
that none of the natives would risk
blowing up these holy men, even for
the sake of destroying his ammunition,
and he was unwilling to keep so
large a quantity of powder amidst
his numerous camp-fires and reckless
soldiery. But the fakis had
made their arrangements. On a certain
night they were to depart, carrying
away all their property into the
great caverns of Mount Kassela, and
fire was to be applied to the house
that held the powder. Had the plot
succeeded, the whole army was lost,
isolated as it was in the midst of
unfriendly tribes, embittered by its
excesses, and by the aggressions and
treachery of its chief, and who, stimulated
by their priests, would in all
probability have exterminated it to
the last man, when it no longer had
cartridges for its defence. The drunken
faki's indiscretion saved Achmet and
his troops; the village was forthwith
surrounded, and the next day the
ammunition was transferred to camp.
Not to rouse the whole population
against him, the Bascha abstained for
the moment from punishing the conspirators,
but he was not the man to
let them escape altogether; and some
time afterwards, Mr Werne, who had
returned to Chartum, received a letter
from his brother, informing him that
nine fakis had been hung on palm-trees
just outside the camp, and that
the magnanimous Achmet proposed
treating forty more in the same
way.</p>

<p>A mighty liar was Effendina Achmet
Bascha, as ever ensnared a foe
or broke faith with a friend. Greedy
and cruel was he also, as only a
Turkish despot can be. One of his
most active and unscrupulous agents
was a bloodsucker named Hassan
Effendi, whom he sent to the country
of the Beni-Amers to collect three
thousand five hundred cows and thirteen
hundred camels, the complement
of their tribute. Although this tribe
had upon the whole behaved very
peaceably, Hassan's first act was to
shoot down a couple of hundred of
them like wild beasts. Then he seized
a large number of camels belonging to
the Haddendas, although the tribe
was at that very time in friendly negotiation
with the Bascha. The Haddendas
revenged themselves by burning
Gos-Rajeb. In proof of their
valour, Hassan's men cut off the ears
of the murdered Beni-Amers, and took
them to Achmet, who gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
money for the trophies. "They had
forced a slave to cut off the ears;
yonder now lies the man&mdash;raving
mad, and bound with cords. Camel-thieves,
too&mdash;no matter to what tribe
they belong&mdash;if caught <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in flagranti</i>,
lose their ears, for which the Bascha
gives a reward. That many a man
who never dreamed of committing a
theft loses his ears in this way, is
easy to understand, for the operation
is performed on the spot." Dawson
Borrer, in his <cite>Campaign in the Kabylie</cite>,
mentions a very similar practice
as prevailing in Marshal Bugeaud's
camp, where ten francs was the fixed
price for the head of a horse-stealer,
it being left to the soldiers who severed
the heads and received the money to
discriminate between horse-stealers
and honest men. Whether Bugeaud
took a hint from the Bascha, or the
Bascha was an admiring imitator of
Bugeaud, remains a matter of doubt.
"Besides many handsome women and
children, Hassan Effendi brought in
two thousand nine hundred cows, and
seven thousand sheep." He might
have been a French prince returning
from a razzia. "For himself he kept
eighty camels, <em>which he said he had
bought</em>." A droll dog, this Hassan
Effendi, but withal rather covetous&mdash;given
to sell his soldier's rations, and
to starve his servants, a single piastre&mdash;about
twopence halfpenny&mdash;being
his whole daily outlay for meat for
his entire household, who lived for
the most part upon durra and water.
If his servants asked for wages, they
received the bastinado. "The Bascha
had given the poor camel-drivers
sixteen cows. The vampire (Hassan)
took upon himself to appropriate thirteen
of them." Mr Werne reported
this robbery to the Bascha, but Achmet
merely replied "<i>malluch</i>"&mdash;signifying,
"it matters not." When
inferior officers received horses as
their share of booty, Hassan bought
them of them, but always forgot to
pay, and the poor subalterns feared
to complain to the Bascha, who favoured
the rogue, and recommended
him to the authorities at Cairo for
promotion to the rank of Bey, because,
as he told Mr Werne with an
ironical smile, Hassan was getting
very old and infirm, and when he
died the Divan would bring charges
against him, and inherit his wealth.
Thus are things managed in Egypt.
No wonder that, where such injustice
and rascality prevail, many are found
to rejoice at the prospect of a change
of rulers. "News from Souakim (on
the Red Sea) of the probable landing
of the English, excite great interest
in camp; from all sides they come to
ask questions of us, thinking that we,
as Franks, must know the intentions
of the invaders. Upon the whole,
they would not be displeased at such
a change of government, particularly
when we tell them of the good pay
and treatment customary amongst the
English; and that with them no officer
has to endure indignities from his
superiors in rank."</p>

<p>"I have now," says Mr Werne,
(page 256,) "been more than half
a year away from Chartum, continually
in the field, and not once have I
enjoyed the great comfort of reposing,
undressed, between clean white sheets,
but have invariably slept in my clothes,
on the ground, or on the short but
practical angarèb. All clean linen
disappears, for the constant perspiration
and chalky dust burns everything;
and the servants do not understand
washing, inasmuch as, contrasted
with their black hides, everything
appears white to them, and for
the last three months no soap has
been obtainable. And in the midst
of this dirty existence, which drags
itself along like a slow fever, suddenly
'Julla!' is the word, and one
hangs for four or five days, eighty or
a hundred leagues, upon the camel's
back, every bone bruised by the rough
motion,&mdash;the broiling sun, thirst, hunger,
and cold, for constant companions.
Man can endure much: I have
gone through far more than I ever
thought I could,&mdash;vomiting and in a
raging fever on the back of a dromedary,
under a midday sun, more dead
than alive, held upon my saddle by
others, and yet I recovered. To have
remained behind would have been to
encounter certain death from the enemy,
or from wild beasts. We have
seen what a man can bear, under the
pressure of necessity; in my present
uniform and monotonous life I compare
myself to the camels tied before
my tent, which sometimes stand up,
sometimes slowly stretch themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
on the ground, careless whether crows
or ravens walk over their backs, constantly
moving their jaws, looking up
at the sun, and then, by way of a
change, taking a mouthful of grass,
but giving no signs of joy or curiosity."</p>

<p>From this state of languid indifference
Mr Werne was suddenly and
pleasurably roused by intelligence
that a second expedition was fitting
out for the White Nile. He and his
brother immediately petitioned the
Bascha for leave to accompany it.
The desired permission was granted
to him, but refused to his brother.
There was too much sickness in the
camp, the Bascha said; he could not
spare his doctor, and lacked confidence
in the Italian, Bellotti. The
fondly-attached brothers were thus
placed in a painful dilemma: they
had hoped to pursue their wanderings
hand in hand, and to pass their
lives together, and loth indeed were
they to sunder in those sickly and
perilous regions. At last they made
up their minds to the parting. It has
been already recorded in Mr Werne's
former work, how, within ten days
of their next meeting, his beloved
brother's eyes were closed in death.</p>

<p>In various respects, Mr Werne's
<cite>Feldzug</cite> is one of the most curious
books of travel and adventure that,
for a very long time, has appeared.
It has three points of particular attraction
and originality. In the first
place, the author wanders in a region
previously unexplored by Christian
and educated travellers, and amongst
tribes whose bare names have reached
the ears of but few Europeans. Secondly,
he campaigns as officer in
such an army as we can hardly realise
in these days of high civilisation and
strict military discipline,&mdash;so wild,
motley, and grotesque are its customs,
composition, and equipment,&mdash;an
army whose savage warriors, strange
practices, and barbarous cruelties,
make us fancy ourselves in presence
of some fierce Moslem horde of the
middle ages, marching to the assault
of Italy or Hungary. Thirdly, during
his long sojourn in camp he
had opportunities such as few ordinary
travellers enjoy, and of which
he diligently profited, to study and
note down the characteristics and
social habits of many of the races of
men that make up the heterogeneous
population of the Ottoman empire.
Some of the physiological and medical
details with which he favours us,
would certainly have been more in
their place in his brother's professional
journal, than in a book intended for
the public at large; and passages
are not wanting at which the squeamish
will be apt to lay down the volume
in disgust. For such persons
Mr Werne does not write; and his
occasional indelicacy and too crude
details are compensated, to our thinking,
by his manly honest tone, and by
the extraordinary amount of useful
and curious information he has managed
to pack into two hundred and
seventy pages. As a whole, the <cite>Expedition
to the White Nile</cite>, which contains
a vast deal of dry meteorological
and geographical detail, is decidedly
far less attractive than the present
book, which is as amusing as
any romance. We have read it with
absorbing interest, well pleased with
the hint its author throws out at its
close, that the records of his African

<h2>MY NOVEL; OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.</h2>

<h3>BY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.</h3>


<h4>BOOK VII.&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER.</h4>

<p>"What is courage?" said my uncle
Roland, rousing himself from a reverie
into which he had fallen after the
Sixth Book in this history had been
read to our family circle.</p>

<p>"What is courage?" he repeated
more earnestly. "Is it insensibility
to fear? <em>That</em> may be the mere
accident of constitution; and, if so,
there is no more merit in being courageous
than in being this table."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear you speak
thus," observed Mr Caxton, "for I
should not like to consider myself a
coward; yet I am very sensible to
fear in all dangers, bodily and moral."</p>

<p>"La, Austin, how can you say so?"
cried my mother, firing up; "was it
not only last week that you faced the
great bull that was rushing after
Blanche and the children?"</p>

<p>Blanche at that recollection stole to
my father's chair, and, hanging over
his shoulder, kissed his forehead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, (sublimely unmoved
by these flatteries.)&mdash;"I don't deny
that I faced the bull, but I assert that
I was horribly frightened."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roland.</span>&mdash;"The sense of honour
which conquers fear is the true courage
of chivalry: you could not run away
when others were looking on&mdash;no
gentleman could."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Fiddledee! It
was not on my gentility that I stood,
Captain. I should have run fast
enough, if it had done any good. I
stood upon my understanding. As
the bull could run faster than I could,
the only chance of escape was to make
the brute as frightened as myself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span>&mdash;"Ah, you did not
think of that; your only thought was
to save me and the children."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Possibly, my
dear&mdash;very possibly I might have
been afraid for you too;&mdash;but I was
very much afraid for myself. However,
luckily I had the umbrella, and
I sprang it up and spread it forth in
the animal's stupid eyes, hurling at
him simultaneously the biggest lines
I could think of in the First Chorus of
the 'Seven against Thebes.' I began
with <span class="smcap">Eledemnas pedioploktupos</span>;
and when I came to the grand howl of
Ἰὼ, ἰὼ, ἰὼ, ἰὼ&mdash;the beast stood appalled
as at the roar of a lion. I shall
never forget his amazed snort at the
Greek. Then he kicked up his hind
legs, and went bolt through the gap in
the hedge. Thus, armed with Æschylus
and the umbrella, I remained master
of the field; but (continued Mr Caxton,
ingenuously,) I should not like
to go through that half minute again."</p>

<p>"No man would," said the Captain
kindly. "I should be very sorry to
face a bull myself, even with a bigger
umbrella than yours, and even
though I had Æschylus, and Homer
to boot, at my fingers' ends."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"You would not
have minded if it had been a Frenchman
with a sword in his hand?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain.</span>&mdash;"Of course not. Rather
liked it than otherwise," he added
grimly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Yet many a
Spanish matador, who doesn't care a
button for a bull, would take to his
heels at the first lunge <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en carte</i> from
a Frenchman. Therefore, in fact, if
courage be a matter of constitution, it
is also a matter of custom. We face
calmly the dangers we are habituated
to, and recoil from those of which we
have no familiar experience. I doubt
if Marshal Turenne himself would
have been quite at his ease on the
tight-rope; and a rope-dancer, who
seems disposed to scale the heavens
with Titanic temerity, might possibly
object to charge on a cannon."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Roland.</span>&mdash;"Still, either
this is not the courage I mean, or
there is another kind of it. I mean
by courage that which is the especial
force and dignity of the human character,
without which there is no
reliance on principle, no constancy in
virtue&mdash;a something," continued my
uncle gallantly, and with a half bow
towards my mother, "which your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
sex shares with our own. When the
lover, for instance, clasps the hand
of his betrothed, and says, 'Wilt thou
be true to me, in spite of absence and
time, in spite of hazard and fortune,
though my foes malign me, though thy
friends may dissuade thee, and our lot
in life may be rough and rude?' and
when the betrothed answers, 'I will
be true,' does not the lover trust to
her courage as well as her love?"</p>

<p>"Admirably put, Roland," said my
father. "But <i>apropos</i> of what do
you puzzle us with these queries on
courage?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Roland</span>, (with a slight
blush.)&mdash;"I was led to the inquiry
(though, perhaps, it may be frivolous
to take so much thought of what, no
doubt, costs Pisistratus so little) by
the last chapters in my nephew's
story. I see this poor boy, Leonard,
alone with his fallen hopes, (though
very irrational they were,) and his
sense of shame. And I read his heart,
I dare say, better than Pisistratus
does, for I could feel like that boy if
I had been in the same position; and,
conjecturing what he and thousands
like him must go through, I asked
myself, 'What can save him and
them?' I answered, as a soldier would
answer, 'Courage!' Very well. But
pray, Austin, what is courage?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, (prudently backing
out of a reply.)&mdash;"<i>Papæ!</i> Brother,
since you have just complimented the
ladies on that quality, you had better
address your question to them."</p>

<p>Blanche here leant both hands on
my father's chair, and said, looking
down at first bashfully, but afterwards
warming with the subject,
"Do you not think, sir, that little
Helen has already suggested, if not
what is courage, what at least is the
real essence of all courage that endures
and conquers, that ennobles,
and hallows, and redeems? Is it not
<span class="smcap">Patience</span>, father?&mdash;and that is why
we women have a courage of our own.
Patience does not affect to be superior
to fear, but at least it never
admits despair."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"Kiss me, my
Blanche, for you have come near to
the truth which perplexed the soldier
and puzzled the sage."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, (tartly.)&mdash;"If you
mean me by the sage, I was not
puzzled at all. Heaven knows you
do right to inculcate patience&mdash;it is a
virtue very much required in your
readers. Nevertheless," added my
father, softening with the enjoyment
of his joke&mdash;"nevertheless Blanche
and Helen are quite right. Patience
is the courage of the conqueror; it is
the virtue, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, of Man
against Destiny&mdash;of the One against
the World, and of the Soul against
Matter. Therefore this is the courage
of the Gospel; and its importance, in
a social view&mdash;its importance to races
and institutions&mdash;cannot be too
earnestly inculcated. What is it that
distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon from
all other branches of the human
family, peoples deserts with his children,
and consigns to them the heritage
of rising worlds? What but his
faculty to brave, to suffer, to endure&mdash;the
patience that resists firmly, and
innovates slowly. Compare him with
the Frenchman. The Frenchman has
plenty of valour&mdash;that there is no
denying; but as for fortitude, he has
not enough to cover the point of a
pin. He is ready to rush out of the
world if he is bit by a flea."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Roland.</span>&mdash;"There was
a case in the papers the other day,
Austin, of a Frenchman who actually
did destroy himself because he was so
teased by the little creatures you
speak of. He left a paper on his
table, saying that 'life was not worth
having at the price of such torments.'"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, (solemnly.)&mdash;"Sir,
their whole political history, since the
great meeting of the Tiers Etat, has
been the history of men who would
rather go to the devil than be bit by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
flea. It is the record of human impatience,
that seeks to force time, and
expects to grow forests from the
spawn of a mushroom. Wherefore,
running through all extremes of constitutional
experiment, when they are
nearest to democracy they are next
door to a despot; and all they have
really done is to destroy whatever
constitutes the foundation of every
tolerable government. A constitutional
monarchy cannot exist without
aristocracy, nor a healthful republic
endure with corruption of manners.
The cry of Equality is incompatible
with Civilisation, which, of necessity,
contrasts poverty with wealth&mdash;and,
in short, whether it be an emperor or
a mob that is to rule, Force is the
sole hope of order, and the government
is but an army.</p>

<p>"Impress, O Pisistratus! impress
the value of patience as regards man
and men. You touch there on the
kernel of the social system&mdash;the secret
that fortifies the individual and disciplines
the million. I care not, for
my part, if you are tedious so long as
you are earnest. Be minute and
detailed. Let the real human life, in
its war with Circumstance, stand out.
Never mind if one can read you but
slowly&mdash;better chance of being less
quickly forgotten. Patience, patience!
By the soul of Epictetus, your readers
shall set you an example!"</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>Leonard had written twice to Mrs
Fairfield, twice to Riccabocca, and
once to Mr Dale; and the poor proud
boy could not bear to betray his humiliation.
He wrote as with cheerful
spirits&mdash;as if perfectly satisfied with
his prospects. He said that he was
well employed, in the midst of books,
and that he had found kind friends.
Then he turned from himself to write
about those whom he addressed, and
the affairs and interests of the quiet
world wherein they lived. He did
not give his own address, nor that of
Mr Prickett. He dated his letters
from a small coffeehouse near the
bookseller, to which he occasionally
went for his simple meals. He had a
motive in this. He did not desire to
be found out. Mr Dale replied for
himself and for Mrs Fairfield, to the
epistles addressed to these two. Riccabocca
wrote also. Nothing could
be more kind than the replies of both.
They came to Leonard in a very dark
period in his life, and they strengthened
him in the noiseless battle with
despair.</p>

<p>If there be a good in the world that
we do without knowing it, without
conjecturing the effect it may have
upon a human soul, it is when we show
kindness to the young in the first
barren footpath up the mountain of life.</p>

<p>Leonard's face resumed its serenity
in his intercourse with his employer;
but he did not recover his boyish
ingenuous frankness. The under-currents
flowed again pure from the turbid
soil and the splintered fragments
uptorn from the deep; but they were
still too strong and too rapid to allow
transparency to the surface. And now
he stood in the sublime world of books,
still and earnest as a seer who invokes
the dead. And thus, face to face with
knowledge, hourly he discovered how
little he knew. Mr Prickett lent him
such works as he selected and asked
to take home with him. He spent
whole nights in reading; and no longer
desultorily. He read no more poetry,
no more Lives of Poets. He read what
poets must read if they desire to be
great&mdash;<cite>Sapere principium et fons</cite>&mdash;strict
reasonings on the human mind;
the relations between motive and conduct,
thought and action; the grave
and solemn truths of the past world;
antiquities, history, philosophy. He
was taken out of himself. He was
carried along the ocean of the universe.
In that ocean, O seeker, study the law
of the tides; and seeing Chance nowhere&mdash;Thought
presiding over all&mdash;Fate,
that dread phantom, shall vanish
from creation, and Providence alone
be visible in heaven and on earth!</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>There was to be a considerable
book-sale at a country house one day's
journey from London. Mr Prickett
meant to have attended it on his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
behalf, and that of several gentlemen
who had given him commissions for
purchase; but, on the morning fixed
for his departure, he was seized with
a severe return of his old foe the
rheumatism. He requested Leonard
to attend instead of himself. Leonard
went, and was absent for the three
days during which the sale lasted.
He returned late in the evening, and
went at once to Mr Prickett's house.
The shop was closed; he knocked at
the private entrance; a strange person
opened the door to him, and, in reply
to his question if Mr Prickett was at
home, said with a long and funereal
face&mdash;"Young man, Mr Prickett
senior is gone to his long home, but
Mr Richard Prickett will see you."</p>

<p>At this moment a very grave-looking
man, with lank hair, looked forth
from the side-door communicating
between the shop and the passage,
land then, stepped forward&mdash;"Come
in, sir; you are my late uncle's assistant,
Mr Fairfield, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Your late uncle! Heavens, sir, do
I understand aright&mdash;can Mr Prickett
be dead since I left London?"</p>

<p>"Died, sir, suddenly last night. It
was an affection of the heart; the
Doctor thinks the rheumatism attacked
that organ. He had small time to
provide for his departure, and his
account-books seem in sad disorder:
I am his nephew and executor."</p>

<p>Leonard had now followed the
nephew into the shop. There, still
burned the gas-lamp. The place
seemed more dingy and cavernous
than before. Death always makes its
presence felt in the house it visits.</p>

<p>Leonard was greatly affected&mdash;and
yet more, perhaps, by the utter want
of feeling which the nephew exhibited.
In fact, the deceased had not been on
friendly terms with this person, his
nearest relative and heir-at-law, who
was also a bookseller.</p>

<p>"You were engaged but by the
week I find, young man, on reference
to my late uncle's papers. He gave
you £1 a week&mdash;a monstrous sum! I
shall not require your services any
further. I shall move these books
to my own house. You will be good
enough to send me a list of those you
bought at the sale, and your account
of travelling-expenses, &amp;c. What may
be due to you shall be sent to your
address. Good evening."</p>

<p>Leonard went home, shocked and
saddened at the sudden death of his
kind employer. He did not think
much of himself that night; but, when
he rose the next day, he suddenly felt
that the world of London lay before
him, without a friend, without a calling,
without an occupation for bread.</p>

<p>This time it was no fancied sorrow,
no poetic dream disappointed. Before
him, gaunt and palpable, stood
Famine.</p>

<p>Escape!&mdash;yes. Back to the village;
his mother's cottage; the exile's garden;
the radishes and the fount. Why
could he not escape? Ask why civilisation
cannot escape its ills, and fly
back to the wild and the wigwam?</p>

<p>Leonard could not have returned to
the cottage, even if the Famine that
faced had already seized him with her
skeleton hand. London releases not
so readily her fated stepsons.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>One day three persons were standing
before an old book-stall in a
passage leading from Oxford Street
into Tottenham Court Road. Two
were gentlemen; the third, of the class
and appearance of those who more
habitually halt at old book-stalls.</p>

<p>"Look," said one of the gentlemen
to the other, "I have discovered here
what I have searched for in vain the
last ten years&mdash;the Horace of 1580,
the Horace of the Forty Commentators&mdash;a
perfect treasury of learning,
and marked only fourteen shillings!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Norreys," said the other,
"and observe what is yet more
worth your study;" and he pointed to
the third bystander, whose face,
sharp and attenuated, was bent with
an absorbed, and, as it were, with
a hungering attention over an old
worm-eaten volume.</p>

<p>"What is the book, my lord?"
whispered Mr Norreys.</p>

<p>His companion smiled, and replied
by another question, "What
is the man who reads the book?"</p>

<p>Mr Norreys moved a few paces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and looked over the student's shoulder
"Preston's translation of <span class="smcap">Boethius</span>,
<cite>The Consolations of Philosophy</cite>," he
said, coming back to his friend.</p>

<p>"He looks as if he wanted all the
consolations Philosophy can give him,
poor boy."</p>

<p>At this moment a fourth passenger
paused at the book-stall, and, recognising
the pale student, placed his
hand on his shoulder and said, "Aha,
young sir, we meet again. So poor
Prickett is dead. But you are still
haunted by associations. Books&mdash;books&mdash;magnets
to which all iron
minds move insensibly. What is
this? <span class="smcap">Boethius!</span> Ah, a book written
in prison, but a little time before
the advent of the only philosopher
who solves to the simplest understanding
every mystery of life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that philosopher?"</p>

<p>"Is Death!" said Mr Burley.
"How can you be dull enough to
ask? Poor Boethius, rich, nobly
born, a consul, his sons consuls&mdash;the
world one smile to the Last Philosopher
of Rome. Then suddenly, against
this type of the old world's departing
<small>WISDOM</small>, stands frowning the new
world's grim genius, <small>FORCE</small>&mdash;Theodoric
the Ostrogoth condemning Boethius
the Schoolman; and Boethius,
in his Pavian dungeon, holding a
dialogue with the shade of Athenian
Philosophy. It is the finest picture
upon which lingers the glimmering
of the Western golden day, before
night rushes over time."</p>

<p>"And," said Mr Norreys abruptly,
"Boethius comes back to us with the
faint gleam of returning light, translated
by Alfred the Great. And,
again, as the sun of knowledge bursts
forth in all its splendour, by Queen
Elizabeth. Boethius influences us as
we stand in this passage; and that is
the best of all the Consolations of
Philosophy&mdash;eh, Mr Burley?"</p>

<p>Mr Burley turned and bowed.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other;
you could not see a greater contrast.
Mr Burley, his gay green dress
already shabby and soiled, with a rent
in the skirts, and his face speaking of
habitual night-cups. Mr Norreys,
neat and somewhat precise in dress,
with firm lean figure, and quiet, collected,
vigorous energy in his eye and
aspect.</p>

<p>"If," replied Mr Burley, "a poor
devil like me may argue with a
gentleman who may command his
own price with the booksellers, I
should say it is no consolation at all,
Mr Norreys. And I should like to
see any man of sense accept the condition
of Boethius in his prison, with
some strangler or headsman waiting
behind the door, upon the promised
proviso that he should be translated,
centuries afterwards, by Kings and
Queens, and help indirectly to influence
the minds of Northern barbarians,
babbling about him in an alley, jostled
by passers-by who never heard the
name of Boethius, and who don't care
a fig for philosophy. Your servant,
sir&mdash;young man, come and talk."</p>

<p>Burley hooked his arm within Leonard's,
and led the boy passively away.</p>

<p>"That is a clever man," said
Harley L'Estrange. "But I am sorry
to see yon young student, with his
bright earnest eyes, and his lip that
has the quiver of passion and enthusiasm,
leaning on the arm of a guide
who seems disenchanted of all that
gives purpose to learning and links
philosophy with use to the world.
Who, and what is this clever man
whom you call Burley?"</p>

<p>"A man who might have been
famous, if he had condescended to be
respectable! The boy listening to
us both so attentively interested <em>me</em>
too&mdash;I should like to have the making
of him. But I must buy this Horace."</p>

<p>The shopman, lurking within his
hole like a spider for flies, was now
called out. And when Mr Norreys
had bought the Horace, and given an
address where to send it, Harley
asked the shopman if he knew the
young man who had been reading
Boethius.</p>

<p>"Only by sight. He has come
here every day the last week, and
spends hours at the stall. When once
he fastens on a book, he reads it
through."</p>

<p>"And never buys?" said Mr Norreys.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the shopman with a
good-natured smile, "they who buy
seldom read. The poor boy pays me
twopence a-day to read as long as he
pleases. I would not take it, but he
is proud."</p>

<p>"I have known men amass great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
learning in that way," said Mr
Norreys. "Yes, I should like to
have that boy in my hands. And
now, my lord, I am at your service,
and we will go to the studio of your
artist."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen walked on
towards one of the streets out of
Fitzroy Square.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more Harley
L'Estrange was in his element,
seated carelessly on a deal table,
smoking his cigar, and discussing art
with the gusto of a man who honestly
loved, and the taste of a man who
thoroughly understood it. The young
artist, in his dressing robe, adding
slow touch upon touch, paused often
to listen the better. And Henry
Norreys, enjoying the brief respite
from a life of great labour, was gladly
reminded of idle hours under rosy
skies; for these three men had
formed their friendship in Italy, where
the bands of friendship are woven
by the hands of the Graces.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p>Leonard and Mr Burley walked on
into the suburbs round the north
road from London, and Mr Burley
offered to find literary employment
for Leonard&mdash;an offer eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Then they went into a public house
by the wayside. Burley demanded a
private room, called for pen, ink, and
paper; and, placing these implements
before Leonard, said, "Write what
you please in prose, five sheets of
letter paper, twenty-two lines to a
page&mdash;neither more nor less."</p>

<p>"I cannot write so."</p>

<p>"Tut, 'tis for bread."</p>

<p>The boy's face crimsoned.</p>

<p>"I must forget that," said he.</p>

<p>"There is an arbour in the garden
under a weeping ash," returned
Burley. "Go there, and fancy yourself
in Arcadia."</p>

<p>Leonard was too pleased to obey.
He found out the little arbour at one
end of a deserted bowling-green. All
was still&mdash;the hedgerow shut out the
sight of the inn. The sun lay warm
on the grass, and glinted pleasantly
through the leaves of the ash. And
Leonard there wrote the first essay
from his hand as Author by profession.
What was it that he wrote?
His dreamy impressions of London?
an anathema on its streets, and its
hearts of stone? murmurs against
poverty? dark elegies on fate?</p>

<p>Oh, no! little knowest thou true
genius, if thou askest such questions,
or thinkest that there, under
the weeping ash, the taskwork for
bread was remembered; or that the
sunbeam glinted but over the practical
world, which, vulgar and sordid,
lay around. Leonard wrote a fairy
tale&mdash;one of the loveliest you can
conceive, with a delicate touch of
playful humour&mdash;in a style all flowered
over with happy fancies. He smiled
as he wrote the last word&mdash;he was
happy. In rather more than an hour
Mr Burley came to him, and found
him with that smile on his lips.</p>

<p>Mr Burley had a glass of brandy
and water in his hand; it was his
third. He too smiled&mdash;he too looked
happy. He read the paper aloud,
and well. He was very complimentary.
"You will do!" said he, clapping
Leonard on the back. "Perhaps
some day you will catch my
one-eyed perch." Then he folded up
the MS., scribbled off a note, put
the whole in one envelope&mdash;and they
returned to London.</p>

<p>Mr Burley disappeared within a
dingy office near Fleet Street, on
which was inscribed&mdash;"Office of
the <cite>Beehive</cite>," and soon came forth
with a golden sovereign in his hand&mdash;Leonard's
first-fruits. Leonard
thought Peru lay before him. He accompanied
Mr Burley to that gentleman's
lodging in Maida Hill. The
walk had been very long; Leonard
was not fatigued. He listened
with a livelier attention than before
to Burley's talk. And when they
reached the apartments of the latter,
and Mr Burley sent to the cookshop,
and their joint supper was taken out
of the golden sovereign, Leonard
felt proud, and for the first time for
weeks he laughed the heart's laugh.
The two writers grew more and more
intimate and cordial. And there was
a vast deal in Burley by which any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
young man might be made the wiser.
There was no apparent evidence of
poverty in the apartments&mdash;clean,
new, well furnished; but all things
in the most horrible litter&mdash;all speaking
of the huge literary sloven.</p>

<p>For several days Leonard almost
lived in those rooms. He wrote continuously&mdash;save
when Burley's conversation
fascinated him into idleness.
Nay, it was not idleness&mdash;his knowledge
grew larger as he listened; but
the cynicism of the talker began slowly
to work its way. That cynicism in
which there was no faith, no hope,
no vivifying breath from Glory&mdash;from
Religion. The cynicism of the Epicurean,
more degraded in his stye than
ever was Diogenes in his tub; and
yet presented with such ease and
such eloquence&mdash;with such art and
such mirth&mdash;so adorned with illustration
and anecdote, so unconscious of
debasement.</p>

<p>Strange and dread philosophy&mdash;that
made it a maxim to squander the
gifts of mind on the mere care for
matter, and fit the soul to live but as
from day to day, with its scornful
cry, "A fig for immortality and
laurels!" An author for bread! Oh,
miserable calling! was there something
grand and holy, after all, even
in Chatterton's despair!</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<p>The villanous <cite>Beehive</cite>! Bread was
worked out of it, certainly; but
fame, but hope for the future&mdash;certainly
not. Milton's <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>
would have perished without a sound,
had it appeared in the <cite>Beehive</cite>.</p>

<p>Fine things were there in a fragmentary
crude state, composed by
Burley himself. At the end of a
week they were dead and forgotten&mdash;never
read by one man of education
and taste; taken simultaneously and
indifferently with shallow politics and
wretched essays, yet selling, perhaps,
twenty or thirty thousand copies&mdash;an
immense sale;&mdash;and nothing got out
of them but bread and brandy!</p>

<p>"What more would you have?"
cried John Burley. "Did not stern
old Sam Johnson say he could never
write but from want?"</p>

<p>"He might say it," answered
Leonard; "but he never meant posterity
to believe him. And he would
have died of want, I suspect, rather
than have written <cite>Rasselas</cite> for the
<cite>Beehive</cite>! Want is a grand thing," continued
the boy, thoughtfully. "A
parent of grand things. Necessity is
strong, and should give us its own
strength; but Want should shatter
asunder, with its very writhings, the
walls of our prison-house, and not
sit contented with the allowance
the jail gives us in exchange for our
work."</p>

<p>"There is no prison-house to a
man who calls upon Bacchus&mdash;stay&mdash;I
will translate to you Schiller's
Dithyramb. 'Then see I Bacchus&mdash;then
up come Cupid and Ph&oelig;bus, and
all the Celestials are filling my dwelling.'"</p>

<p>Breaking into impromptu careless
rhymes, Burley threw off a rude but
spirited translation of that divine
lyric.</p>

<p>"O materialist!" cried the boy,
with his bright eyes suffused.
"Schiller calls on the gods to take
him to their heaven with him; and
you would debase the gods to a gin
palace."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried Burley, with his
giant laugh. "Drink, and you will
understand the Dithyramb."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<p>Suddenly one morning, as Leonard
sate with Barley, a fashionable cabriolet,
with a very handsome horse,
stopped at the door&mdash;a loud knock&mdash;a
quick step on the stairs, and Randal
Leslie entered. Leonard recognised
him, and started. Randal glanced at
him in surprise, and then, with a tact
that showed he had already learned
to profit by London life, after shaking
hands with Burley, approached,
and said with some successful attempt
at ease, "Unless I am not
mistaken, sir, we have met before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
If you remember me, I hope all boyish
quarrels are forgotten?"</p>

<p>Leonard bowed, and his heart was
still good enough to be softened.</p>

<p>"Where could you two ever have
met?" asked Burley.</p>

<p>"In a village green, and in single
combat," answered Randal, smiling;
and he told the story of the Battle of
the Stocks, with a well-bred jest on
himself. Burley laughed at the story.
"But," said he, when this laugh was
over, "my young friend had better
have remained guardian of the village
stocks, than come to London in search
of such fortune as lies at the bottom
of an inkhorn."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Randal, with the secret
contempt which men elaborately
cultivated are apt to feel for those
who seek to educate themselves&mdash;"ah,
you make literature your calling,
sir? At what school did you
conceive a taste for letters?&mdash;not very
common at our great public schools."</p>

<p>"I am at school now for the first
time," answered Leonard, drily.</p>

<p>"Experience is the best schoolmistress,"
said Burley; "and that
was the maxim of Goethe, who had
book-learning enough, in all conscience."</p>

<p>Randal slightly shrugged his
shoulders, and, without wasting another
thought on Leonard, peasant-born
and self-taught, took his seat,
and began to talk to Burley upon a
political question, which made then
the war-cry between the two great
Parliamentary parties. It was a
subject in which Burley showed much
general knowledge; and Randal, seeming
to differ from him, drew forth
alike his information and his argumentative
powers. The conversation
lasted more than an hour.</p>

<p>"I can't quite agree with you,"
said Randal, taking his leave; "but
you must allow me to call again&mdash;will
the same hour to-morrow suit
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Burley.</p>

<p>Away went the young man in his
cabriolet. Leonard watched him from
the window.</p>

<p>For five days, consecutively, did
Randal call and discuss the question
in all its bearings; and Burley, after
the second day, got interested in the
matter, looked up his authorities&mdash;refreshed
his memory&mdash;and even spent
an hour or two in the Library of the
British Museum.</p>

<p>By the fifth day, Burley had really
exhausted all that could well be said
on his side of the question.</p>

<p>Leonard, during these colloquies,
had sate apart, seemingly absorbed
in reading, and secretly stung by
Randal's disregard of his presence.
For indeed that young man, in his
superb self-esteem, and in the absorption
of his ambitious projects, scarce
felt even curiosity as to Leonard's
rise above his earlier station, and
looked on him as a mere journeyman
of Burley's. But the self-taught are
keen and quick observers. And
Leonard had remarked, that Randal
seemed more as one playing a part
for some private purpose, than arguing
in earnest; and that, when he rose
and said, "Mr Burley, you have convinced
me," it was not with the
modesty of a sincere reasoner, but the
triumph of one who has gained his
end. But so struck, meanwhile, was
our unheeded and silent listener, with
Burley's power of generalisation, and
the wide surface over which his information
extended, that when Randal
left the room the boy looked at
the slovenly purposeless man, and
said aloud&mdash;"True; knowledge is <em>not</em>
power."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Burley, drily&mdash;"the
weakest thing, in the world."</p>

<p>"Knowledge is power," muttered
Randal Leslie, as, with a smile on his
lip, he drove from the door.</p>

<p>Not many days after this last
interview there appeared a short
pamphlet; anonymous, but one which
made a great impression on the town.
It was on the subject discussed
between Randal and Burley. It was
quoted at great length in the newspapers.
And Burley started to his
feet one morning, and exclaimed,
"My own thoughts! my very
words! Who the devil is this pamphleteer?"</p>

<p>Leonard took the newspaper from
Burley's hand. The most flattering
encomiums preceded the extracts,
and the extracts were as stereotypes
of Burley's talk.</p>

<p>"Can you doubt the author?" cried
Leonard, in deep disgust and ingenuous
scorn. "The young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
who came to steal your brains, and
turn your knowledge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into power," interrupted Burley,
with a laugh, but it was a laugh of
pain. "Well, this was very mean; I
shall tell him so when he comes."</p>

<p>"He will come no more," said
Leonard. Nor did Randal come
again. But he sent Mr Burley a copy
of the pamphlet with a polite note,
saying, with candid but careless acknowledgment,
that "he had profited
much by Mr Burley's hints and
remarks."</p>

<p>And now it was in all the papers,
that the pamphlet which had made so
great a noise was by a very young
man, Mr Audley Egerton's relation.
And high hopes were expressed of
the future career of Mr Randal
Leslie.</p>

<p>Burley still attempted to laugh, and
still his pain was visible. Leonard
most cordially despised and hated
Randal Leslie, and his heart moved
to Burley with noble but perilous
compassion. In his desire to soothe
and comfort the man whom he deemed
cheated out of fame, he forgot the
caution he had hitherto imposed on
himself, and yielded more and more
to the charm of that wasted intellect.
He accompanied Burley now where
he went to spent his evenings, and
more and more&mdash;though gradually,
and with many a recoil and self-rebuke&mdash;there
crept over him the
cynic's contempt for glory, and miserable
philosophy of debased content.</p>

<p>Randal had risen into grave repute
upon the strength of Burley's knowledge.
But, had Burley written the
pamphlet, would the same repute
have attended <em>him</em>? Certainly not.
Randal Leslie brought to that knowledge
qualities all his own&mdash;a style
simple, strong, and logical; a certain
tone of good society, and allusions to
men and to parties that showed his
connection with a cabinet minister,
and proved that he had profited no
less by Egerton's talk than Burley's.</p>

<p>Had Burley written the pamphlet,
it would have showed more genius,
it would have had humour and wit,
but have been so full of whims and
quips, sins against taste, and defects
in earnestness, that it would have
failed to create any serious sensation.
Here, then, there was something
else besides knowledge, by which
knowledge became power. Knowledge
must not smell of the brandy
bottle.</p>

<p>Randal Leslie might be mean in
his plagiarism, but he turned the
useless into use. And so far he was
original.</p>

<p>But one's admiration, after all, rests
where Leonard's rested&mdash;with the
poor, shabby, riotous, lawless, big
fallen man.</p>

<p>Burley took himself off to the Brent,
and fished again for the one-eyed
perch. Leonard accompanied him.
His feelings were indeed different
from what they had been when he
had reclined under the old tree, and
talked with Helen of the future. But
it was almost pathetic to see how
Burley's nature seemed to alter, as he
strayed along the banks of the rivulet,
and talked of his own boyhood. The
man then seemed restored to something
of the innocence of the child.
He cared, in truth, little for the perch,
which continued intractable, but he
enjoyed the air and the sky, the
rustling grass and the murmuring
waters. These excursions to the
haunts of youth seemed to rebaptise
him, and then his eloquence took a
pastoral character, and Isaac Walton
himself would have loved to hear
him. But as he got back into the
smoke of the metropolis, and the gas
lamps made him forget the ruddy
sunset, and the soft evening star, the
gross habits reassumed their sway;
and on he went with his swaggering
reckless step to the orgies in which
his abused intellect flamed forth, and
then sank into the socket quenched
and rayless.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<p>Helen was seized with profound
and anxious sadness. Leonard had
been three or four times to see her,
and each time she saw a change in
him that excited all her fears. He
seemed, it is true, more shrewd,
more worldly-wise, more fitted, it
might be, for coarse daily life; but, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the other hand, the freshness and glory
of his youth were waning slowly.
His aspirings drooped earthward.
He had not mastered the Practical,
and moulded its uses with the
strong hand of the Spiritual Architect,
of the Ideal Builder: the Practical was
overpowering himself. She grew pale
when he talked of Burley, and shuddered,
poor little Helen! when she
found he was daily and almost nightly
in a companionship which, with her
native honest prudence, she saw so unsuited
to strengthen him in his struggles,
and aid him against temptation. She
almost groaned when, pressing him as
to his pecuniary means, she found his
old terror of debt seemed fading away,
and the solid healthful principles he
had taken from his village were
loosening fast. Under all, it is true,
there was what a wiser and older
person than Helen would have hailed
as the redeeming promise. But that
something was <em>grief</em>&mdash;a sublime grief
in his own sense of falling&mdash;in his own
impotence against the Fate he had
provoked and coveted. The sublimity
of that grief Helen could not detect:
she saw only that it <em>was</em> grief, and she
grieved with it, letting it excuse every
fault&mdash;making her more anxious to
comfort, in order that she might save.
Even from the first, when Leonard
had exclaimed, "Ah, Helen, why did
you ever leave me?" she had revolved
the idea of return to him; and
when in the boy's last visit he told her
that Burley, persecuted by duns, was
about to fly from his present lodgings,
and take his abode with Leonard in
the room she had left vacant, all doubt
was over. She resolved to sacrifice
the safety and shelter of the home
assured her. She resolved to come back
and share Leonard's penury and
struggles, and save the old room,
wherein she had prayed for him, from
the tempter's dangerous presence.
Should she burden him? No; she
had assisted her father by many little
female arts in needle and fancy work.
She had improved herself in these
during her sojourn with Miss Starke.
She could bring her share to the common
stock. Possessed with this idea,
she determined to realise it before the
day on which Leonard had told her
Burley was to move his quarters.
Accordingly she rose very early one
morning; she wrote a pretty and
grateful note to Miss Starke, who
was fast asleep, left it on the table,
and, before any one was astir, stole
from the house, her little bundle on
her arm. She lingered an instant at
the garden-gate, with a remorseful
sentiment&mdash;a feeling that she had ill-repaid
the cold and prim protection
that Miss Starke had shown her. But
sisterly love carried all before it. She
closed the gate with a sigh, and
went on.</p>

<p>She arrived at the lodging-house
before Leonard was up, took possession
of her old chamber, and, presenting
herself to Leonard as he was
about to go forth, said, (story-teller
that she was,)&mdash;"I am sent away,
brother, and I have, come to you to
take care of me. Do not let us part
again. But you must be very cheerful
and very happy, or I shall think
that I am sadly in your way."</p>

<p>Leonard at first did look cheerful,
and even happy; but then he thought
of Burley, and then of his own means
of supporting her, and was embarrassed,
and began questioning Helen
as to the possibility of reconciliation
with Miss Starke. And Helen said
gravely, "Impossible&mdash;do not ask it,
and do not go near her."</p>

<p>Then Leonard thought she had
been humbled and insulted, and remembered
that she was a gentleman's
child, and felt for her wounded pride&mdash;he
was so proud himself. Yet still
he was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Shall I keep the purse again,
Leonard?" said Helen coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied Leonard, "the
purse is empty."</p>

<p>"That is very naughty in the
purse," said Helen, "since you put
so much into it."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Did not you say that you made,
at least, a guinea a-week?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but Burley takes the money;
and then, poor fellow! as I owe all to
him, I have not the heart to prevent
his spending it as he likes."</p>

<p>"Please, I wish you could settle
the month's rent," said the landlady,
suddenly showing herself. She said
it civilly, but with firmness.</p>

<p>Leonard coloured. "It shall be
paid to-day."</p>

<p>Then he pressed his hat on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
head, and, putting Helen gently aside,
went forth.</p>

<p>"Speak to <em>me</em> in future, kind Mrs
Smedley," said Helen with the air of
a housewife. "<em>He</em> is always in study,
and must not be disturbed."</p>

<p>The landlady&mdash;a good woman,
though she liked her rent&mdash;smiled
benignly. She was fond of Helen,
whom she had known of old.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you are come back;
and perhaps now the young man will
not keep such late hours. I meant to
give him warning, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he will be a great man one
of these days, and you must bear with
him now." And Helen kissed Mrs
Smedley, and sent her away half inclined
to cry.</p>

<p>Then Helen busied herself in the
rooms. She found her father's box,
which had been duly forwarded. She
re-examined its contents, and wept as
she touched each humble and pious
relic. But her father's memory itself
thus seemed to give this home a sanction
which the former had not; and she
rose quietly and began mechanically
to put things in order, sighing as she,
saw all so neglected, till she came to
the rose-tree, and that alone showed
heed and care. "Dear Leonard!"
she murmured, and the smile resettled
on her lips.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, could have
severed Leonard from Burley but
Helen's return to his care. It was
impossible for him, even had there
been another room in the house
vacant, (which there was not,) to install
this noisy riotous son of the
Muse by Bacchus, talking at random,
and smelling of spirits, in the same
dwelling with an innocent, delicate,
timid, female child. And Leonard
could not leave her alone all the
twenty-four hours. She restored a
home to him, and imposed its duties.
He therefore told Mr Burley that in
future he should write and study in
his own room, and hinted with many
a blush, and as delicately as he could,
that it seemed to him that whatever
he obtained from his pen ought to be
halved with Burley, to whose interest
he owed the employment, and from
whose books or whose knowledge he
took what helped to maintain it; but
that the other half, if his, he could no
longer afford to spend upon feasts or
libations. He had another to provide
for.</p>

<p>Burley pooh-poohed the notion
of taking half his coadjutor's earning,
with much grandeur, but spoke
very fretfully of Leonard's sober
appropriation of the other half; and,
though a good-natured warm-hearted
man, felt extremely indignant against
the sudden interposition of poor
Helen. However, Leonard was firm;
and then Burley grew sullen, and
so they parted. But the rent was
still to be paid. How? Leonard
for the first time thought of the pawnbroker.
He had clothes to spare,
and Riccabocca's watch. No; that
last he shrank from applying to such
base uses.</p>

<p>He went home at noon, and met
Helen at the street door. She too
had been out, and her soft cheek was
rosy red with unwonted exercise and
the sense of joy. She had still preserved
the few gold pieces which
Leonard had taken back to her on
his first visit to Miss Starke's. She
had now gone out and bought wools
and implements for work; and meanwhile
she had paid the rent.</p>

<p>Leonard did not object to the work,
but he blushed deeply when he knew
about the rent, and was very angry.
He payed back to her that night
what she had advanced; and Helen
wept silently at his pride, and wept
more when she saw the next day a
woeful hiatus in his wardrobe.</p>

<p>But Leonard now worked at home,
and worked resolutely; and Helen
sate by his side, working too; so
that next day, and the next, slipped
peacefully away, and in the evening of
the second he asked her to walk out
in the fields. She sprang up joyously
at the invitation, when bang went the
door, and in reeled John Burley&mdash;drunk:&mdash;And
so drunk!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>


<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<p>And with Burley there reeled in
another man&mdash;a friend of his&mdash;a man
who had been a wealthy trader and
once well to do, but who, unluckily,
had literary tastes, and was fond of
hearing Burley talk. So, since he had
known the wit, his business had fallen
from him, and he had passed through
the Bankrupt Court. A very shabby-looking
dog he was, indeed, and his
nose was redder than Burley's.</p>

<p>John made a drunken dash at poor
Helen. "So you are the Pentheus in
petticoats who defies Bacchus," cried
he; and therewith he roared out a
verse from Euripides. Helen ran
away, and Leonard interposed.</p>

<p>"For shame, Burley!"</p>

<p>"He's drunk," said Mr Douce the
bankrupt trader&mdash;"very drunk&mdash;don't
mind&mdash;him. I say, sir, I hope we
don't intrude. Sit still, Burley, sit
still, and talk, do&mdash;that's a good man.
You should hear him&mdash;ta&mdash;ta&mdash;talk,
sir."</p>

<p>Leonard meanwhile had got Helen
out of the room, into her own, and
begged her not to be alarmed, and
keep the door locked. He then returned
to Burley, who had seated
himself on the bed, trying wondrous
hard to keep himself upright; while
Mr Douce was striving to light a short
pipe that he carried in his buttonhole&mdash;without
having filled it&mdash;and,
naturally failing in that attempt, was
now beginning to weep.</p>

<p>Leonard was deeply shocked and
revolted for Helen's sake; but it was
hopeless to make Burley listen to
reason. And how could the boy turn
out of his room the man to whom he
was under obligations?</p>

<p>Meanwhile there smote upon Helen's
shrinking, ears loud jarring talk and
maudlin laughter, and cracked attempts
at jovial songs. Then she
heard Mrs Smedley in Leonard's
room, remonstrating, and Burley's
laugh was louder than before, and Mrs
Smedley, who was a meek woman,
evidently got frightened, and was heard
in precipitate retreat. Long and loud
talk recommenced, Burley's great
voice predominant, Mr Douce chiming
in with hiccupy broken treble.
Hour after hour this lasted, for want
of the drink that would have brought
it to a premature close. And Burley
gradually began to talk himself somewhat
sober. Then Mr Douce was
heard descending the stairs, and
silence followed. At dawn, Leonard
knocked at Helen's door. She opened
it at once, for she had not gone to
bed.</p>

<p>"Helen," said he very sadly, "you
cannot continue here. I must find
out some proper home for you. This
man has served me when all London
was friendless, and he tells me that he
has nowhere else to go&mdash;that the
bailiffs are after him. He has now
fallen asleep. I will go and find you
some lodging close at hand&mdash;for I cannot
expel him who has protected me;
and yet you cannot be under the same
roof with him. My own good angel,
I must lose you."</p>

<p>He did not wait for her answer,
but hurried down the stairs.</p>

<p>The morning looked through the
shutterless panes in Leonard's garret,
and the birds began to chirp from the
elm-tree, when Burley rose and shook
himself, and stared round. He could
not quite make out where he was.
He got hold of the water-jug which he
emptied at three draughts, and felt
greatly refreshed. He then began to
reconnoitre the chamber&mdash;looked at
Leonard's MSS.&mdash;peeped into the
drawers&mdash;wondered where the devil
Leonard himself had gone to&mdash;and
finally amused himself by throwing
down the fire-irons, ringing the bell,
and making all the noise he could, in
the hopes of attracting the attention
of somebody or other, and procuring
himself his morning dram.</p>

<p>In the midst of this <i>charivari</i> the door
opened softly, but as if with a resolute
hand, and the small quiet form of
Helen stood before the threshold.
<span class="smcap">Burley</span> turned round, and the two
looked at each other for some moments
with silent scrutiny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burley</span>, (composing his features
into their most friendly expression.)&mdash;"Come
hither, my dear. So you are
the little girl whom I saw with Leonard
on the banks of the Brent, and you
have come back to live with him&mdash;and
I have come to live with him too. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
shall be our little housekeeper, and I
will tell you the story of Prince
Prettyman, and a great many others
not to be found in <cite>Mother Goose</cite>.
Meanwhile, my dear little girl, here's
sixpence&mdash;just run out and change this
for its worth in rum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>, (coming slowly up to Mr
Burley, and still gazing earnestly into
his face.)&mdash;"Ah, sir, Leonard says
you have a kind heart, and that you
have served him&mdash;he cannot ask you
to leave the house; and so I, who have
never served him, am to go hence and
live alone."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burley</span>, (moved.)&mdash;"You go, my
little lady?&mdash;and why? Can we not
all live together?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"No, sir. I left everything
to come to Leonard, for we had
met first at my father's grave. But
you rob me of him, and I have no
other friend on earth."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burley</span>, (discomposed.)&mdash;"Explain
yourself. Why must you leave
him because I come?"</p>

<p>Helen looks at Mr Burley again, long
and wistfully, but makes no answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burley</span>, (with a gulp.)&mdash;"Is it
because he thinks I am not fit company
for you?"</p>

<p>Helen bowed her head.</p>

<p>Burley winced, and after a moment's
pause said,&mdash;"He is right."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>, (obeying the impulse at her
heart, springs forward and takes
Burley's hand.)&mdash;"Ah, sir," she
cried, "before he knew you he was so
different&mdash;then he was cheerful&mdash;then,
even when his first disappointment
came, I grieved and wept; but I felt
he would conquer still&mdash;for his heart
was so good and pure. Oh, sir, don't
think I reproach you; but what is to
become of him if&mdash;if&mdash;No, it is not for
myself I speak. I know that if I
was here, that if he had me to care
for, he would come home early&mdash;and
work patiently&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;that I
might save him. But now when I am
gone, and you with him&mdash;you to whom
he is grateful, you whom he would
follow against his own conscience,
(you must see that, sir)&mdash;what is to
become of him?"</p>

<p>Helen's voice died in sobs.</p>

<p>Burley took three or four long
strides through the room&mdash;he was
greatly agitated. "I am a demon,"
he murmured. "I never saw it before&mdash;but
it is true&mdash;I should be this boy's
ruin." Tears stood in his eyes, he
paused abruptly, made a clutch at his
hat, and turned to the door.</p>

<p>Helen stopped the way, and, taking
him gently by the arm, said,&mdash;"Oh, sir,
forgive me&mdash;I have pained you;" and
looked up at him with a compassionate
expression, that indeed made the
child's sweet face as that of an
angel.</p>

<p>Burley bent down as if to kiss her,
and then drew back&mdash;perhaps with a
sentiment that his lips were not worthy
to touch that innocent brow.</p>

<p>"If I had had a sister&mdash;a child
like you, little one," he muttered,
"perhaps I too might have been
saved in time. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, now you may stay, sir; I
don't fear you any more."</p>

<p>"No, no; you would fear me again
ere night-time, and I might not be
always in the right mood to listen to
a voice like yours, child. Your
Leonard has a noble heart and rare
gifts. He should rise yet, and he
shall. I will not drag him into the
mire. Good-bye&mdash;you will see me no
more." He broke from Helen, cleared
the stairs with a bound, and was out
of the house.</p>

<p>When Leonard returned he was
surprised to hear his unwelcome guest
was gone&mdash;but Helen did not venture
to tell him of her interposition. She
knew instinctively how such officiousness
would mortify and offend
the pride of man&mdash;but she never
again spoke harshly of poor Burley.
Leonard supposed that he should
either see or hear of the humourist
in the course of the day. Finding
he did not, he went in search of
him at his old haunts; but no trace.
He inquired at the <cite>Beehive</cite> if they
knew there of his new address, but no
tidings of Burley could be obtained.</p>

<p>As he came home disappointed
and anxious, for he felt uneasy as
to the disappearance of his wild
friend, Mrs Smedley met him at the
door.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, suit yourself with
another lodging," said she. "I can
have no such singings and shoutings
going on at night in my house. And
that poor little girl, too!&mdash;you should
be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>Leonard frowned, and passed by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>


<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, on leaving Helen, Burley
strode on; and, as if by some better
instinct, for he was unconscious of his
own steps, he took the way towards
the still green haunts of his youth.
When he paused at length, he was
already before the door of a rural
cottage, standing alone in the midst
of fields, with a little farm-yard at
the back; and far through the trees
in front was caught a glimpse of the
winding Brent.</p>

<p>With this cottage Burley was familiar;
it was inhabited by a good old
couple who had known him from a
boy. There he habitually left his
rods and fishing-tackle; there, for
intervals in his turbid riotous life, he
had sojourned for two or three days
together&mdash;fancying the first day
that the country was a heaven, and
convinced before the third that it was
a purgatory.</p>

<p>An old woman, of neat and tidy
exterior, came forth to greet him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Master John," said she clasping
his nerveless hand&mdash;"well, the
fields be pleasant now&mdash;I hope you
are come to stay a bit? Do; it will
freshen you: you lose all the fine
colour you had once, in Lunnon
town."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you, my kind
friend," said Burley with unusual
meekness&mdash;"I can have the old room,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, come and look at it. I
never let it now to any one but you&mdash;never
have let it since the dear
beautiful lady with the angel's face
went away. Poor thing, what could
have become of her?"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, while Burley listened
not, the old woman drew him
within the cottage, and led him up
the stairs into a room that might
have well become a better house, for
it was furnished with taste, and even
elegance. A small cabinet pianoforte
stood opposite the fireplace, and the
window looked upon pleasant meads
and tangled hedgerows, and the narrow
windings of the blue rivulet.
Burley sank down exhausted, and
gazed wistfully from the casement.</p>

<p>"You have not breakfasted?" said
the hostess anxiously.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, the eggs are fresh laid, and
you would like a rasher of bacon, Master
John? And if you <em>will</em> have brandy
in your tea, I have some that you left
long ago in your own bottle."</p>

<p>Burley shook his head. "No
brandy, Mrs Goodyer; only fresh
milk. I will see whether I can yet
coax Nature."</p>

<p>Mrs Goodyer did not know what
was meant by coaxing Nature, but
she said, "Pray do, Master John,"
and vanished.</p>

<p>That day Burley went out with his
rod, and he fished hard for the one-eyed
perch: but in vain. Then he
roved along the stream with his
hands in his pockets, whistling. He
returned to the cottage at sunset,
partook of the fare provided for him,
abstained from the brandy, and felt
dreadfully low. He called for pen,
ink, and paper, and sought to write,
but could not achieve two lines. He
summoned Mrs Goodyer, "Tell your
husband to come and sit and talk."</p>

<p>Up came old Jacob Goodyer, and
the great wit bade him tell him all
the news of the village. Jacob
obeyed willingly, and Burley at last
fell asleep. The next day it was
much the same, only at dinner he had
up the brandy bottle, and finished it;
and he did <em>not</em> have up Jacob, but
he contrived to write.</p>

<p>The third day it rained incessantly.
"Have you no books, Mrs Goodyer?"
asked poor John Burley.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, some that the dear lady
left behind her; and perhaps you
would like to look at some papers in
her own writing?"</p>

<p>"No, not the papers&mdash;all women
scribble, and all scribble the same
things. Get me the books."</p>

<p>The books were brought up&mdash;poetry
and essays&mdash;John knew them by
heart. He looked out on the rain,
and at evening the rain had ceased.
He rushed to his hat and fled.</p>

<p>"Nature, Nature!" he exclaimed
when he was out in the air and hurrying
by the dripping hedgerows,
"you are not to be coaxed by me!
I have jilted you shamefully, I own
it; you are a female and unforgiving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
I don't complain. You may
be very pretty, but you are the stupidest
and most tiresome companion
that ever I met with. Thank heaven,
I am not married to you!"</p>

<p>Thus John Burley made his way
into town, and paused at the first
public house. Out of that house he
came with a jovial air, and on he
strode towards the heart of London.
Now he is in Leicester Square, and
he gazes on the foreigners who stalk
that region, and hums a tune; and
now from yonder alley two forms
emerge, and dog his careless footsteps;
now through the maze of passages
towards St Martin's he threads his
path, and, anticipating an orgy as he
nears his favourite haunts, jingles the
silver in his pockets; and now the
two forms are at his heels.</p>

<p>"Hail to thee, O Freedom!" muttered
John Burley, "thy dwelling is
in cities, and thy palace is the
tavern."</p>

<p>"In the king's name," quoth a
gruff voice; and John Burley feels
the horrid and familiar tap on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>The two bailiffs who dogged have
seized their prey.</p>

<p>"At whose suit?" asked John
Burley falteringly.</p>

<p>"Mr Cox, the wine-merchant."</p>

<p>"Cox! A man to whom I gave a
cheque on my bankers, not three
months ago!"</p>

<p>"But it warn't cashed."</p>

<p>"What does that signify?&mdash;the
intention was the same. A good
heart takes the will for the deed.
Cox is a monster of ingratitude; and
I withdraw my custom."</p>

<p>"Sarve him right. Would your
honour like a jarvey?"</p>

<p>"I would rather spend the money
on something else," said John Burley.
"Give me your arm, I am not proud.
After all, thank heaven, I shall not
sleep in the country."</p>

<p>And John Burley made a night of
it in the Fleet.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<p>Miss Starke was one of those ladies
who pass their lives in the direst of
all civil strife&mdash;war with their servants.
She looked upon the members
of that class as the unrelenting
and sleepless enemies of the unfortunate
householders condemned to
employ them. She thought they ate
and drank to their villanous utmost,
in order to ruin their benefactors&mdash;that
they lived in one constant
conspiracy with one another and the
tradesmen, the object of which was
to cheat and pilfer. Miss Starke
was a miserable woman. As she
had no relations or friends who
cared enough for her to share her
solitary struggle against her domestic
foes; and her income, though easy,
was an annuity that died with herself,
thereby reducing various nephews,
nieces, or cousins, to the strict bounds
of a natural affection&mdash;that did not
exist; and as she felt the want of
some friendly face amidst this world
of distrust and hate, so she had tried
the resource of venal companions.
But the venal companions had never
staid long&mdash;either they disliked Miss
Starke, or Miss Starke disliked them.
Therefore the poor woman had resolved
upon bringing up some little
girl whose heart, as she said to herself,
would be fresh and uncorrupted,
and from whom she might expect
gratitude. She had been contented,
on the whole, with Helen, and had
meant to keep that child in her house
as long as she (Miss Starke) remained
upon the earth&mdash;perhaps some thirty
years longer; and then, having carefully
secluded her from marriage, and
other friendship, to leave her nothing
but the regret of having lost so kind
a benefactress. Agreeably with this
notion, and in order to secure the
affections of the child, Miss Starke
had relaxed the frigid austerity natural
to her manner and mode of
thought, and been kind to Helen in
an iron way. She had neither slapped
nor pinched her, neither had she
starved. She had allowed her to
see Leonard, according to the agreement
made with Dr Morgan, and had
laid out tenpence on cakes, besides
contributing fruit from her garden for
the first interview&mdash;a hospitality she
did not think it fit to renew on subsequent
occasions. In return for this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
she conceived she had purchased the
right to Helen bodily and spiritually,
and nothing could exceed her indignation
when she rose one morning
and found the child had gone. As it
never had occurred to her to ask
Leonard's address, though she suspected
Helen had gone to him, she
was at a loss what to do, and remained
for twenty-four hours in a
state of inane depression. But then
she began to miss the child so much
that her energies woke, and she persuaded
herself that she was actuated
by the purest benevolence in trying
to reclaim this poor creature from the
world into which Helen had thus
rashly plunged.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she put an advertisement
into the <cite>Times</cite>, to the following
effect, liberally imitated from
one by which, in former years, she had
recovered a favourite Blenheim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">TWO GUINEAS REWARD.</p>

<p>Strayed, from Ivy Cottage, Highgate,
a Little Girl, answers to the
name of Helen; with blue eyes and
brown hair; white muslin frock, and
straw hat with blue ribbons. Whoever
will bring the same to Ivy Cottage, shall
receive the above Reward.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Nothing more will be offered.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, it so happened that Mrs
Smedley had put an advertisement in
the <cite>Times</cite> on her own account, relative
to a niece of hers who was coming
from the country, and for whom she
desired to find a situation. So, contrary
to her usual habit, she sent for
the newspaper, and, close by her
own advertisement, she saw Miss
Starke's.</p>

<p>It was impossible that she could
mistake the description of Helen;
and, as this advertisement caught her
eye the very day after the whole
house had been disturbed and scandalised
by Burley's noisy visit, and
on which she had resolved to get rid
of a lodger who received such visitors,
the goodhearted woman was delighted
to think that she could restore Helen
to some safe home. While thus
thinking, Helen herself entered the
kitchen where Mrs Smedley sate,
and the landlady had the imprudence
to point out the advertisement, and
talk, as she called it, "seriously" to
the little girl.</p>

<p>Helen in vain and with tears entreated
her to take no step in reply to the
advertisement. Mrs Smedley felt it
was an affair of duty, and was obdurate,
and shortly afterwards put on her
bonnet and left the house. Helen conjectured
that she was on her way to
Miss Starke's, and her whole soul was
bent on flight. Leonard had gone to
the office of the <cite>Beehive</cite> with his MSS.;
but she packed up all their joint
effects, and, just as she had done so, he
returned. She communicated the
news of the advertisement, and said
she should be so miserable if compelled
to go back to Miss Starke's,
and implored him so pathetically to
save her from such sorrow that he at
once assented to her proposal of flight.
Luckily, little was owing to the landlady&mdash;that
little was left with the
maid-servant; and, profiting by Mrs
Smedley's absence, they escaped
without scene or conflict. Their
effects were taken by Leonard to a
stand of hackney vehicles, and then
left at a coach-office, while they went
in search of lodgings. It was wise to
choose an entirely new and remote
district; and before night they were
settled in an attic in Lambeth.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIII.</h4>

<p>As the reader will expect, no
trace of Burley could Leonard find:
the humourist had ceased to communicate
with the <cite>Beehive</cite>. But Leonard
grieved for Burley's sake; and
indeed, he missed the intercourse of
the large wrong mind. But he settled
down by degrees to the simple loving
society of his child companion, and in
that presence grew more tranquil.
The hours in the daytime that he did
not pass at work he spent as before,
picking up knowledge at bookstalls;
and at dusk he and Helen would
stroll out&mdash;sometimes striving to
escape from the long suburb into
fresh rural air; more often wandering
to and fro the bridge that led
to glorious Westminster&mdash;London's
classic land&mdash;and watching the vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
lamps reflected on the river. This
haunt suited the musing melancholy
boy. He would stand long and with
wistful silence by the balustrade&mdash;seating
Helen thereon, that she too
might look along the dark mournful
waters which, dark though they be,
still have their charm of mysterious
repose.</p>

<p>As the river flowed between the
world of roofs, and the roar of human
passions on either side, so in those
two hearts flowed Thought&mdash;and all
they knew of London was its shadow.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIV.</h4>

<p>There appeared in the <cite>Beehive</cite> certain
very truculent political papers&mdash;papers
very like the tracts in the
Tinker's bag. Leonard did not heed
them much, but they made far more
sensation in the public that read the
<cite>Beehive</cite> than Leonard's papers, full
of rare promise though the last were.
They greatly increased the sale of the
periodical in the manufacturing towns,
and began to awake the drowsy vigilance
of the Home Office. Suddenly
a descent was made upon the <cite>Beehive</cite>,
and all its papers and plant.
The editor saw himself threatened
with a criminal prosecution, and the
certainty of two years' imprisonment:
he did not like the prospect, and disappeared.
One evening, when Leonard,
unconscious of these mischances,
arrived at the door of the office, he
found it closed. An agitated mob was
before it, and a voice that was not
new to his ear was haranguing the
bystanders, with many imprecations
against "tyrans." He looked, and,
to his amaze, recognised in the orator
Mr Sprott the Tinker.</p>

<p>The police came in numbers to disperse
the crowd, and Mr Sprott
prudently vanished. Leonard learned
then what had befallen, and again
saw himself without employment
and the means of bread.</p>

<p>Slowly he walked back. "O,
knowledge, knowledge!&mdash;powerless
indeed!" he murmured.</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, a handbill in
large capitals met his eyes on a dead
wall&mdash;"Wanted, a few smart young
men for India."</p>

<p>A crimp accosted him&mdash;"You
would make a fine soldier, my man.
You have stout limbs of your own."
Leonard moved on.</p>

<p>"It has come back, then, to this.
Brute physical force after all! O
Mind, despair! O Peasant, be a
machine again."</p>

<p>He entered his attic noiselessly,
and gazed upon Helen as she sate at
work, straining her eyes by the open
window&mdash;with tender and deep compassion.
She had not heard him
enter, nor was she aware of his presence.
Patient and still she sate,
and the small fingers plied busily.
He gazed, and saw that her cheek
was pale and hollow, and the hands
looked so thin! His heart was deeply
touched, and at that moment he had
not one memory of the baffled Poet,
one thought that proclaimed the
Egotist.</p>

<p>He approached her gently, laid his
hand on her shoulder&mdash;"Helen, put
on your shawl and bonnet, and walk
out&mdash;I have much to say."</p>

<p>In a few moments she was ready,
and they took their way to their
favourite haunt upon the bridge.
Pausing in one of the recesses or
nooks, Leonard then began,&mdash;"Helen,
we must part."</p>

<p>"Part?&mdash;Oh, brother!"</p>

<p>"Listen. All work that depends
on mind is over for me; nothing remains
but the labour of thews and
sinews. I cannot go back to my village
and say to all, 'My hopes were
self-conceit, and my intellect a delusion!'
I cannot. Neither in this sordid
city can I turn menial or porter.
I might be born to that drudgery,
but my mind has, it may be unhappily,
raised me above my birth. What,
then, shall I do? I know not yet&mdash;serve
as a soldier, or push my way
to some wilderness afar, as an emigrant,
perhaps. But whatever my
choice, I must henceforth be alone;
I have a home no more. But there
is a home for you, Helen, a very
humble one, (for you, too, so well
born,) but very safe&mdash;the roof of&mdash;of&mdash;my
peasant mother. She will love
you for my sake, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen clung to him trembling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
sobbed out, "Anything, anything
you will. But I can work; I can
make money, Leonard. I do, indeed,
make money&mdash;you do not know how
much&mdash;but enough for us both till
better times come to you. Do not let
us part."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;a man, and born to
labour, to be maintained by the work
of an infant! No, Helen, do not so
degrade me."</p>

<p>She drew back as she looked on his
flushed brow, bowed her head submissively,
and murmured, "Pardon."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Helen, after a pause,
"if now we could but find my poor
father's friend! I never so much
cared for it before."</p>

<p>"Yes, he would surely provide for
you."</p>

<p>"For <em>me</em>!" repeated Helen, in a
tone of soft deep reproach, and she
turned away her head to conceal her
tears.</p>

<p>"You are sure you would remember
him, if we met him by chance?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. He was so different
from all we see in this terrible city,
and his eyes were like yonder stars,
so clear and so bright; yet the light
seemed to come from afar off, as the
light does in yours, when your
thoughts are away from all things
round you. And then, too, his dog
whom he called Nero&mdash;I could not
forget that."</p>

<p>"But his dog may not be always
with him."</p>

<p>"But the bright clear eyes are!
Ah, now you look up to heaven,
and yours seem to dream like his."</p>

<p>Leonard did not answer, for his
thoughts were indeed less on earth
than struggling to pierce into that
remote and mysterious heaven.</p>

<p>Both were silent long; the crowd
passed them by unheedingly. Night
deepened over the river, but the reflection
of the lamplights on its waves
was more visible than that of the
stars. The beams showed the darkness
of the strong current, and the
craft that lay eastward on the tide,
with sail-less spectral masts and black
dismal hulks, looked deathlike in their
stillness.</p>

<p>Leonard looked down, and the
thought of Chatterton's grim suicide
came back to his soul, and a pale
scornful face with luminous haunting
eyes seemed to look up from the stream,
and murmur from livid lips,&mdash;"Struggle
no more against the tides
on the surface&mdash;all is calm and rest
within the deep."</p>

<p>Starting in terror from the gloom
of his reverie, the boy began to talk
fast to Helen, and tried to soothe her
with descriptions of the lowly home
which he had offered.</p>

<p>He spoke of the light cares which
she would participate with his
mother&mdash;for by that name he still
called the widow&mdash;and dwelt, with
an eloquence that the contrast round
him made sincere and strong, on
the happy rural life, the shadowy
woodlands, the rippling cornfields,
the solemn lone church-spire soaring
from the tranquil landscape. Flatteringly
he painted the flowery terraces
of the Italian exile, and the playful
fountain that, even as he spoke, was
flinging up its spray to the stars,
through serene air untroubled by the
smoke of cities, and untainted by the
sinful sighs of men. He promised her
the love and protection of natures
akin to the happy scene: the simple
affectionate mother&mdash;the gentle pastor&mdash;the
exile wise and kind&mdash;Violante,
with dark eyes full of the
mystic thoughts that solitude calls
from childhood,&mdash;Violante should be
her companion.</p>

<p>"And oh!" cried Helen, "if life
be thus happy there, return with me,
return&mdash;return!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" murmured the boy, "if
the hammer once strike the spark
from the anvil, the spark must fly
upward; it cannot fall back to earth
until light has left it. Upward still,
Helen&mdash;let me go upward still!"</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XV.</h4>

<p>The next morning Helen was very
ill&mdash;so ill that, shortly after rising,
she was forced to creep back to bed.
Her frame shivered&mdash;her eyes were
heavy&mdash;her hand burned like fire.
Fever had set in. Perhaps she might
have caught cold on the bridge&mdash;perhaps
her emotions had proved too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
much for her frame. Leonard, in
great alarm, called on the nearest
apothecary. The apothecary looked
grave, and said there was danger.
And danger soon declared itself&mdash;Helen
became delirious. For several
days she lay in this state, between
life and death. Leonard then felt
that all the sorrows of earth are
light, compared with the fear of
losing what we love. How valueless
the envied laurel seemed beside the
dying rose.</p>

<p>Thanks, perhaps, more to his heed
and tending than to medical skill, she
recovered sense at last&mdash;immediate
peril was over. But she was very
weak and reduced&mdash;her ultimate recovery
doubtful&mdash;convalescence, at
best, likely to be very slow.</p>

<p>But when she learned how long she
had been thus ill, she looked anxiously
at Leonard's face as he bent over
her, and faltered forth&mdash;"Give me my
work; I am strong enough for that
now&mdash;it would amuse me."</p>

<p>Leonard burst into tears.</p>

<p>Alas! he had no work himself; all
their joint money had melted away;
the apothecary was not like good Dr
Morgan: the medicines were to be
paid for, and the rent. Two days
before, Leonard had pawned Riccabocca's
watch; and when the last
shilling thus raised was gone, how
should he support Helen? Nevertheless
he conquered his tears, and assured
her that he had employment; and
that so earnestly that she believed
him, and sank into soft sleep. He
listened to her breathing, kissed her
forehead, and left the room. He
turned into his own neigbouring
garret, and, leaning his face on his
hands, collected all his thoughts.</p>

<p>He must be a beggar at last. He
must write to Mr Dale for money&mdash;Mr
Dale, too, who knew the secret
of his birth. He would rather have
begged of a stranger&mdash;it seemed to
add a new dishonour to his mother's
memory for the child to beg of one
who was acquainted with her shame.
Had he himself been the only one to want
and to starve, he would have sunk inch
by inch into the grave of famine, before
he would have so subdued his pride.
But Helen, there on that bed&mdash;Helen
needing, for weeks perhaps, all support,
and illness making luxuries
themselves like necessaries! Beg he
must. And when he so resolved, had
you but seen the proud bitter soul he
conquered, you would have said&mdash;"This
which he thinks is degradation&mdash;this
is heroism. Oh strange human
heart!&mdash;no epic ever written achieves
the Sublime and the Beautiful which
are graven, unread by human eye,
in thy secret leaves." Of whom else
should he beg? His mother had nothing,
Riccabocca was poor, and the
stately Violante, who had exclaimed,
"Would that I were a man!"&mdash;he
could not endure the thought that she
should pity him, and despise. The
Avenels! No&mdash;thrice No. He drew
towards him hastily ink and paper,
and wrote rapid lines, that were
wrung from him as from the bleeding
strings of life.</p>

<p>But the hour for the post had
passed&mdash;the letter must wait till the
next day; and three days at least
would elapse before he could receive
an answer. He left the letter on the
table, and, stifling as for air, went
forth. He crossed the bridge&mdash;he
passed on mechanically&mdash;and was
borne along by a crowd pressing
towards the doors of Parliament.
A debate that excited popular interest
was fixed for that evening, and many
bystanders collected in the street to
see the members pass to and fro,
or hear what speakers had yet risen to
take part in the debate, or try to get
orders for the gallery.</p>

<p>He halted amidst these loiterers, with
no interest, indeed, in common with
them, but looking over their heads
abstractedly towards the tall Funeral
Abbey&mdash;Imperial Golgotha of Poets,
and Chiefs, and Kings.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was diverted
to those around by the sound of a
name&mdash;displeasingly known to him.
"How are you, Randal Leslie?
coming to hear the debate?" said a
member who was passing through
the street.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mr Egerton promised to get
me under the gallery. He is to speak
himself to-night, and I have never
heard him. As you are going into
the House, will you remind him?"</p>

<p>"I can't now, for he is speaking
already&mdash;and well too. I hurried from
the Athenæum, where I was dining,
on purpose to be in time, as I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that his speech was making a great
effect."</p>

<p>"This is very unlucky," said Randal.
"I had no idea he would speak
so early."</p>

<p>"M&mdash;&mdash; brought him up by a direct
personal attack. But follow me; perhaps
I can get you into the House;
and a man like you, Leslie, of whom
we expect great things some day, I
can tell you, should not miss any
such opportunity of knowing what
this House of ours is on a field night.
Come on!"</p>

<p>The member hurried towards the
door; and as Randal followed him, a
bystander cried&mdash;"That is the young
man who wrote the famous pamphlet&mdash;Egerton's
relation."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said another.
"Clever man, Egerton&mdash;I am waiting
for him."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"Why, you are not a constituent,
as I am."</p>

<p>"No; but he has been very kind to
my nephew, and I must thank him.
You are a constituent&mdash;he is an
honour to your town."</p>

<p>"So he is: Enlightened man!"</p>

<p>"And so generous!"</p>

<p>"Brings forward really good measures,"
quoth the politician.</p>

<p>"And clever young men," said the
uncle.</p>

<p>Therewith one or two others joined
in the praise of Audley Egerton, and
many anecdotes of his liberality were
told.</p>

<p>Leonard listened at first listlessly,
at last with thoughtful attention. He
had heard Burley, too, speak highly
of this generous statesman, who,
without pretending to genius himself,
appreciated it in others. He suddenly
remembered, too, that Egerton was
half-brother to the Squire. Vague
notions of some appeal to this eminent
person, not for charity, but employ
to his mind, gleamed across him&mdash;inexperienced
boy that he yet was! And,
while thus meditating, the door of the
House opened, and out came Audley
Egerton himself. A partial cheering,
followed by a general murmur, apprised
Leonard of the presence of the
popular statesman. Egerton was
caught hold of by some five or six
persons in succession; a shake of the
hand, a nod, a brief whispered word
or two, sufficed the practised member
for graceful escape; and soon, free
from the crowd, his tall erect figure
passed on, and turned towards the
bridge. He paused at the angle and
took out his watch, looking at it by
the lamp-light.</p>

<p>"Harley will be here soon," he
muttered&mdash;"he is always punctual;
and now that I have spoken, I can
give him an hour or so. That is well."</p>

<p>As he replaced his watch in his
pocket, and re-buttoned his coat over
his firm broad chest, he lifted his eyes,
and saw a young man standing before
him.</p>

<p>"Do you want me?" asked the
statesman, with the direct brevity of
his practical character.</p>

<p>"Mr Egerton," said the young
man, with a voice that slightly trembled,
and yet was manly amidst
emotion, "you have a great name,
and great power&mdash;I stand here in
these streets of London without a
friend, and without employ. I believe
that I have it in me to do some
nobler work than that of bodily labour,
had I but one friend&mdash;one opening for
my thoughts. And now I have said
this, I scarcely know how, or why,
but from despair, and the sudden impulse
which that despair took from the
praise that follows your success, I
have nothing more to add."</p>

<p>Audley Egerton was silent for a moment,
struck by the tone and address
of the stranger; but the consummate
and wary man of the world, accustomed
to all manner of strange applications,
and all varieties of imposture,
quickly recovered from a passing
and slight effect.</p>

<p>"Are you a native of &mdash;&mdash;?" (naming
the town he represented as member.)</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, young man, I am very
sorry for you; but the good sense you
must possess (for I judge of that by the
education you have evidently received)
must tell you that a public man,
whatever be his patronage, has it too
fully absorbed by claimants who have
a right to demand it, to be able to
listen to strangers."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and, as
Leonard stood silent, added, with
more kindness than most public men
so accosted would have showed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say you are friendless&mdash;poor
fellow. In early life that happens to
many of us, who find friends enough
before the close. Be honest, and
well-conducted; lean on yourself, not
on strangers; work with the body if
you can't with the mind; and, believe
me, that advice is all I can give you,
unless this trifle,"&mdash;and the minister
held out a crown piece.</p>

<p>Leonard bowed, shook his head
sadly, and walked away. Egerton
looked after him with a slight
pang.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said he to himself, "there
must be thousands in the same state
in these streets of London. I cannot
redress the necessities of civilisation.
Well educated! It is not from ignorance
henceforth that society will suffer&mdash;it
is from over-educating the
hungry thousands who, thus unfitted
for manual toil, and with no career
for mental, will some day or other
stand like that boy in our streets,
and puzzle wiser ministers than I
am."</p>

<p>As Egerton thus mused, and passed
on to the bridge, a bugle-horn rang
merrily from the box of a gay four-in-hand.
A drag-coach with superb
blood-horses rattled over the causeway,
and in the driver Egerton recognised
his nephew&mdash;Frank Hazeldean.</p>

<p>The young Guardsman was returning,
with a lively party of men, from
dining at Greenwich; and the careless
laughter of these children of pleasure
floated far over the still river.</p>

<p>It vexed the ear of the careworn
statesman&mdash;sad, perhaps, with all his
greatness, lonely amidst all his crowd
of friends. It reminded him, perhaps,
of his own youth, when such parties
and companionships were familiar to
him, though through them all he bore
an ambitious aspiring soul&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le jeu,
vaut-il la chandelle?</i>" said he, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>

<p>The coach rolled rapidly past Leonard,
as he stood leaning against the
corner of the bridge, and the mire of
the kennel splashed over him from the
hoofs of the fiery horses. The laughter
smote on his ear more discordantly
than on the minister's, but it begot no
envy.</p>

<p>"Life is a dark riddle," said he,
smiting his breast.</p>

<p>And he walked slowly on, gained
the recess where he had stood several
nights before with Helen; and dizzy
with want of food, and worn out for
want of sleep, he sank down into
the dark corner; while the river that
rolled under the arch of stone muttered
dirge-like in his ear;&mdash;as under
the social key-stone wails and rolls
on for ever the mystery of Human
Discontent. Take comfort, O Thinker
by the stream! 'Tis the river that
founded and gave pomp to the city;
and without the discontent, where
were progress&mdash;what were Man?
Take comfort, O <span class="smcap">Thinker</span>! where ever
the stream over which thou
bendest, or beside which thou sinkest,
weary and desolate, frets the arch
that supports thee;&mdash;never dream
that, by destroying the bridge, thou
canst silence the moan of the wave!</p>

<h2>DISFRANCHISEMENT OF THE BOROUGHS.</h2>

<h3>TO WALTER BINKIE, ESQ., PROVOST OF DREEPDAILY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Provost</span>,&mdash;In the course
of your communings with nature on
the uplands of Dreepdaily, you must
doubtless have observed that the
advent of a storm is usually preceded
by the appearance of a flight of seamaws,
who, by their discordant
screams, give notice of the approaching
change of weather. For some
time past it has been the opinion of
those who are in the habit of watching
the political horizon, that we
should do well to prepare ourselves
for a squall, and already the premonitory
symptoms are distinctly audible.
The Liberal press, headed by the
<cite>Times</cite>, is clamorous for some sweeping
change in the method of Parliamentary
representation; and Lord
John Russell, as you are well aware,
proposes in the course of next Session
to take up the subject. This is no
mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">brutum fulmen</i>, or dodge to
secure a little temporary popularity&mdash;it
is a distinct party move for a
very intelligible purpose; and is
fraught, I think, with much danger
and injustice to many of the constituencies
which are now intrusted with
the right of franchise. As you, my
dear Provost, are a Liberal both by
principle and profession, and moreover
chief magistrate of a very old
Scottish burgh, your opinion upon
this matter must have great weight
in determining the judgment of others;
and, therefore, you will not, I trust,
consider it too great a liberty, if, at
this dull season of the year, I call
your attention to one or two points
which appear well worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place, I think you will
admit that extensive organic changes
in the Constitution ought never to be
attempted except in cases of strong
necessity. The real interests of the
country are never promoted by internal
political agitation, which unsettles
men's minds, is injurious to regular
industry, and too often leaves behind
it the seeds of jealousy and discord
between different classes of the community,
ready on some future occasion
to burst into noxious existence.
You would not, I think, wish to see
annually renewed that sort of strife
which characterised the era of the
Reform Bill. I venture to pass no
opinion whatever on the abstract
merits of that measure. I accept it
as a fact, just as I accept other changes
in the Constitution of this country
which took place before I was born;
and I hope I shall ever comport myself
as a loyal and independent
elector. But I am sure you have far
too lively a recollection of the ferment
which that event created, to wish to
see it renewed, without at least some
urgent cause. You were consistently
anxious for the suppression of rotten
boroughs, and for the enlargement of
the constituency upon a broad and
popular basis; and you considered
that the advantages to be gained by
the adoption of the new system, justified
the social risks which were incurred
in the endeavour to supersede
the old one. I do not say that you
were wrong in this. The agitation
for Parliamentary Reform had been
going on for a great number of years;
the voice of the majority of the country
was undeniably in your favour,
and you finally carried your point.
Still, in consequence of that struggle,
years elapsed before the heart-burnings
and jealousies which were occasioned
by it were allayed. Even now
it is not uncommon to hear the reminiscences
of the Reform Bill appealed
to on the hustings by candidates who
have little else to say for themselves
by way of personal recommendation.
A most ludicrous instance of this
occurred very lately in the case of a
young gentleman, who, being desirous
of Parliamentary honours, actually
requested the support of the electors
on the ground that his father or grandfather&mdash;I
forget which&mdash;had voted for
the Reform Bill; a ceremony which
he could not very well have performed
in his own person, as at that time
he had not been released from the
bondage of swaddling-clothes! I
need hardly add that he was rejected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
but the anecdote is curious and instructive.</p>

<p>In a country such as this, changes
must be looked for in the course of
years. One system dies out, or becomes
unpopular, and is replaced by
a new one. But I cannot charge my
memory with any historical instance
where a great change was attempted
without some powerful or cogent
reason. Still less can I recollect any
great change being proposed, unless a
large and powerful section of the
community had unequivocally declared
in its favour. The reason of this is
quite obvious. The middle classes of
Great Britain, however liberal they
may be in their sentiments, have a
just horror of revolutions. They
know very well that organic changes
are never effected without enormous
loss and individual deprivation, and
they will not move unless they are
assured that the value of the object to
be gained is commensurate with the
extent of the sacrifice. In defence of
their liberties, when these are attacked,
the British people are ever
ready to stand forward; but I mistake
them much, if they will at any
time allow themselves to be made the
tools of a faction. The attempt to
get up organic changes for the sole
purpose of perpetuating the existence
of a particular Ministry, or of maintaining
the supremacy of a particular
party, is a new feature in our history.
It is an experiment which the nation
ought not to tolerate for a single
moment; and which I am satisfied it
will not tolerate, when the schemes
of its authors are laid bare.</p>

<p>I believe, Provost, I am right in
assuming that there has been no decided
movement in favour of a New
Parliamentary Reform Bill, either in
Dreepdaily or in any of the other
burghs with which you are connected.
The electors are well satisfied with
the operation of the ten-pound clause,
which excludes from the franchise no
man of decent ability and industry,
whilst it secures property from those
direct inroads which would be the
inevitable result of a system of universal
suffrage. Also, I suppose, you
are reasonably indifferent on the subjects
of Vote by Ballot and Triennial
Parliaments, and that you view the
idea of annual ones with undisguised
reprobation. Difference of opinion
undoubtedly may exist on some of
these points: an eight-pound qualification
may have its advocates, and
the right of secret voting may be convenient
for members of the clique;
but, on the whole, you are satisfied
with matters as they are; and, certainly,
I do not see that you have any
grievance to complain of. If I were
a member of the Liberal party, I
should be very sorry to see any
change of the representation made in
Scotland. Just observe how the
matter stands. At the commencement
of the present year the whole
representation of the Scottish burghs
was in the hands of the Liberal party.
Since then, it is true, Falkirk has
changed sides; but you are still remarkably
well off; and I think that
out of thirty county members, eighteen
may be set down as supporters of the
Free-trade policy. Remember, I do
not guarantee the continuance of
these proportions: I wish you simply
to observe how you stand at present,
under the working of your own Reform
Bill; and really it appears to me
that nothing could be more satisfactory.
The Liberal who wishes to
have more men of his own kidney
from Scotland must indeed be an unconscionable
glutton; and if, in the
face of these facts, he asks for a reform
in the representation, I cannot
set him down as other than a consummate
ass. He must needs admit
that the system has worked well.
Scotland sends to the support of the
Whig Ministry, and the maintenance
of progressive opinions, a brilliant
phalanx of senators; amongst whom
we point, with justifiable pride, to
the distinguished names of Anderson,
Bouverie, Ewart, Hume, Smith,
M'Taggart, and M'Gregor. Are
these gentlemen not liberal enough
for the wants of the present age?
Why, unless I am most egregiously
mistaken&mdash;and not I only, but the
whole of the Liberal press in Scotland&mdash;they
are generally regarded as
decidedly ahead even of my Lord John
Russell. Why, then, should your
representation be reformed, while it
bears such admirable fruit? With
such a growth of golden pippins on
its boughs, would it not be madness
to cut down the tree, on the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
chance of another arising from the
stump, more especially when you
cannot hope to gather from it a more
abundant harvest? I am quite sure,
Provost, that you agree with me in
this. You have nothing to gain, but
possibly a good deal to lose, by any
alteration which may be made; and
therefore it is, I presume, that in this
part of the world not the slightest
wish has been manifested for a radical
change of the system. That very
conceited and shallow individual, Sir
Joshua Walmsley, made not long
ago a kind of agitating tour through
Scotland, for the purpose of getting
up the steam; but except from a few
unhappy Chartists, whose sentiments
on the subject of property are identically
the same with those professed
by the gentlemen who plundered the
Glasgow tradesmen's shops in 1848,
he met with no manner of encouragement.
The electors laughed in the
face of this ridiculous caricature of
Peter the Hermit, and advised him,
instead of exposing his ignorance in
the north, to go back to Bolton
and occupy himself with his own
affairs.</p>

<p>This much I have said touching
the necessity or call for a new Reform
Bill, which is likely enough to
involve us, for a considerable period
at least, in unfortunate political strife.
I have put it to you as a Liberal, but
at the same time as a man of common
sense and honesty, whether there are
any circumstances, under your knowledge,
which can justify such an
attempt; and in the absence of these,
you cannot but admit that such an
experiment is eminently dangerous
at the present time, and ought to be
strongly discountenanced by all men,
whatever may be their kind of political
opinions. I speak now without any
reference whatever to the details. It
may certainly be possible to discover
a better system of representation than
that which at present exists. I never
regarded Lord John Russell as the
living incarnation of Minerva, nor
can I consider any measure originated
by him as conveying an assurance
that the highest amount of human
wisdom has been exhausted in its
preparation. But what I do say is
this, that in the absence of anything
like general demand, and failing the
allegation of any marked grievance
to be redressed, no Ministry is entitled
to propose an extensive or
organic change in the representation
of the country; and the men who
shall venture upon such a step must
render themselves liable to the imputation
of being actuated by other
motives than regard to the public
welfare.</p>

<p>You will, however, be slow to
believe that Lord John Russell is
moving in this matter without some
special reason. In this you are perfectly
right. He has a reason, and a
very cogent one, but not such a reason
as you, if you are truly a Liberal,
and not a mere partisan, can accept.
I presume it is the wish of the Liberal
party&mdash;at least it used to be their
watchword&mdash;that public opinion in
this country is not to be slighted
or suppressed. With the view of
giving full effect to that public opinion,
not of securing the supremacy of this
or that political alliance, the Reform
Act was framed; it being the declared
object and intention of its founders that
a full, fair, and free representation
should be secured to the people of
this country. The property qualification
was fixed at a low rate; the
balance of power as between counties
and boroughs was carefully adjusted;
and every precaution was taken&mdash;at
least so we were told at the time&mdash;that
no one great interest of the State
should be allowed unduly to predominate
over another. Many, however,
were of opinion at the time, and have
since seen no reason to alter it, that
the adjustment then made, as between
counties and boroughs, was by no
means equitable, and that an undue
share in the representation was given
to the latter, more especially in England.
That, you will observe, was a
Conservative, not a Liberal objection;
and it was over-ruled. Well, then,
did the Representation, as fixed by
the Reform Bill, fulfil its primary
condition? You thought so; and so
did my Lord John Russell, until some
twelve months ago, when a new light
dawned upon him. That light has
since increased in intensity, and he
now sees his way, clearly enough, to
a new organic measure. Why is
this? Simply, my dear Provost,
because the English boroughs will no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
longer support him in his bungling
legislation, or countenance his unnational
policy!</p>

<p>Public opinion, as represented
through the operation of the Reform
Act, is no longer favourable to Lord
John Russell. The result of recent
elections, in places which were formerly
considered as the strongholds
of Whiggery, have demonstrated to
him that the Free-trade policy, to
which he is irretrievably pledged, has
become obnoxious to the bulk of the
electors, and that they will no longer
accord their support to any Ministry
which is bent upon depressing British
labour and sapping the foundations of
national prosperity. So Lord John
Russell, finding himself in this position,
that he must either get rid of public
opinion or resign his place, sets about
the concoction of a new Reform Bill,
by means of which he hopes to swamp
the present electoral body! This is
Whig liberty in its pure and original
form. It implies, of course, that the
Reform Bill did not give a full, fair,
and free representation to the country,
else there can be no excuse for altering
its provisions. If we really have
a fair representation; and if, notwithstanding,
the majority of the electors
are convinced that Free Trade is not
for their benefit, it does appear to me
a most monstrous thing that they are
to be coerced into receiving it by
the infusion of a new element into the
Constitution, or a forcible change in
the distribution of the electoral power,
to suit the commercial views which
are in favour with the Whig party.
It is, in short, a most circuitous
method of exercising despotic power;
and I, for one, having the interests of
the country at heart, would much
prefer the institution at once of a pure
despotism, and submit to be ruled and
taxed henceforward at the sweet will
of the scion of the house of Russell.</p>

<p>I do not know what your individual
sentiments may be on the subject of
Free Trade; but whether you are for
it or against it, my argument remains
the same. It is essentially a question
for the solution of the electoral body;
and if the Whigs are right in their
averment that its operation hitherto
has been attended with marked success,
and has even transcended the
expectation of its promoters, you
may rely upon it that there is no
power in the British Empire which can
overthrow it. No Protectionist ravings
can damage a system which has
been productive of real advantage to
the great bulk of the people. But if,
on the contrary, it is a bad system, is
it to be endured that any man or
body of men shall attempt to perpetuate
it against the will of the majority
of the electors, by a change in
the representation of the country?
I ask you this as a Liberal. Without
having any undue diffidence in the
soundness of your own judgment, I
presume you do not, like his Holiness
the Pope, consider yourself infallible,
or entitled to coerce others who may
differ from you in opinion. Yet this
is precisely what Lord John Russell
is now attempting to do; and I warn
you and others who are similarly
situated, to be wise in time, and to
take care lest, under the operation of
this new Reform Bill, you are not
stripped of that political power and
those political privileges which at
present you enjoy.</p>

<p>Don't suppose that I am speaking
rashly or without consideration. All
I know touching this new Reform
Bill, is derived from the arguments
and proposals which have been advanced
and made by the Liberal press
in consequence of the late indications
of public feeling, as manifested by
the result of recent elections. It is
rather remarkable that we heard few
or no proposals for an alteration in
the electoral system, until it became
apparent that the voice of the boroughs
could no longer be depended on for
the maintenance of the present commercial
policy. You may recollect
that the earliest of the victories which
were achieved by the Protectionists,
with respect to vacant seats in the
House of Commons, were treated
lightly by their opponents as mere
casualties; but when borough after
borough deliberately renounced its
adherence to the cause of the League,
and, not unfrequently under circumstances
of very marked significance,
declared openly in favour of Protection,
the matter became serious. It
was <em>then</em>, and then only, that we
heard the necessity for some new and
sweeping change in the representation
of this country broadly asserted; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
singularly enough, the advocates of
that change do not attempt to disguise
their motives. They do not
venture to say that the intelligence of
the country is not adequately represented
at present&mdash;what they complain
of is, that the intelligence of the
country is becoming every day more
hostile to their commercial theories.
In short, they want to get rid of that
intelligence, and must get rid of it
speedily, unless their system is to
crumble to pieces. Such is their aim
and declared object; and if you entertain
any doubts on the matter, I
beg leave to refer you to the recorded
sentiments of the leading Ministerial
and Free-trade organ&mdash;the <cite>Times</cite>. It
is always instructive to notice the
hints of the Thunderer. The writers
in that journal are fully alive to the
nature of the coming crisis. They
have been long aware of the reaction
which has taken place throughout the
country on the subject of Free Trade,
and they recognise distinctly the peril
in which their favourite principle is
placed, if some violent means are not
used to counteract the conviction of
the electoral body. They see that,
in the event of a general election, the
constituencies of the Empire are not
likely to return a verdict hostile to
the domestic interests of the country.
They have watched with careful and
anxious eyes the turning tide of
opinion; and they can devise no
means of arresting it, without having
recourse to that peculiar mode of
manipulation, which is dignified by the
name of Burking. Let us hear what
they say so late as the 21st of July
last.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With such a prospect before us, with
unknown struggles and unprecedented
collisions within the bounds of possibility,
there is only one resource, and we must
say that Her Majesty's present advisers
will be answerable for the consequences
if they do not adopt it. They must lay
the foundation of an appeal to the people
with a large and liberal measure of
Parliamentary reform. It is high time
that this great country should cease to
quake and to quail at the decisions of stupid
and corrupt little constituencies, of whom,
as in the case before us, it would take
thirty to make one metropolitan borough.
The great question always before the
nation in one shape or another is&mdash;whether
<em>the people</em> are as happy as laws
can make them? To what sort of constituencies
shall we appeal for the answer
to this question? To Harwich with its
population of 3370; to St Albans with
its population of 6246; to Scarborough
with its population of 9953; to Knaresborough
with its population of 5382; and
to a score other places still more insignificant?
Or shall we insist on the appeal
being made to much larger bodies? The
average population of boroughs and
counties is more than 60,000. Is it not
high time to require that no single
borough shall fall below half or a third
of that number?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The meaning of this is clear enough.
It points, if not to the absolute annihilation,
most certainly to the concretion
of the smaller boroughs
throughout England&mdash;to an entire
remarshalling of the electoral ranks&mdash;and,
above all, to an enormous increase
in the representation of the
larger cities. In this way, you see,
local interests will be made almost
entirely to disappear; and London
alone will secure almost as many
representatives in Parliament as are
at the present time returned for the
whole kingdom of Scotland. Now, I
confess to you, Provost, that I do not
feel greatly exhilarated at the prospect
of any such change. I believe
that the prosperity of Great Britain
depends upon the maintenance of
many interests, and I cannot see how
that can be secured if we are to deliver
over the whole political power
to the masses congregated within the
towns. Moreover, I would very
humbly remark, that past experience
is little calculated to increase the
measure of our faith in the wisdom or
judgment of large constituencies. I
may be wrong in my estimate of the
talent and abilities of the several
honourable members who at present
sit for London and the adjacent districts;
but, if so, I am only one out
of many who labour under a similar
delusion. We are told by the <cite>Times</cite>
to look to Marylebone as an example
of a large and enlightened constituency.
I obey the mandate; and on
referring to the Parliamentary Companion,
I find that Marylebone
is represented by Lord Dudley Stuart
and Sir Benjamin Hall. That fact
does not, in my humble opinion,
furnish a conclusive argument in
favour of large constituencies. As I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
wish to avoid the Jew question, I
shall say nothing about Baron Rothschild;
but passing over to the Tower
Hamlets, I find them in possession of
Thomson and Clay; Lambeth rejoicing
in d'Eyncourt and Williams;
and Southwark in Humphrey and
Molesworth. Capable senators though
these may be, I should not like to
see a Parliament composed entirely
of men of their kidney; nor do I think
that they afford undoubted materials
for the construction of a new Cabinet.</p>

<p>But perhaps I am undervaluing the
abilities of these gentlemen; perhaps
I am doing injustice to the discretion
and wisdom of the metropolitan constituencies.
Anxious to avoid any
such imputation, I shall again invoke
the assistance of the <cite>Times</cite>, whom I
now cite as a witness, and a very
powerful one, upon my side of the
question. Let us hear the Thunderer
on the subject of these same metropolitan
constituencies, just twelve
months ago, before Scarborough and
Knaresborough had disgraced themselves
by returning Protectionists to
Parliament. I quote from a leader in
the <cite>Times</cite> of 8th August 1850, referring
to the Lambeth election, when
Mr Williams was returned.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When it was proposed some twenty
years ago to extend the franchise to the
metropolitan boroughs, the presumption
was, that the quality of the representatives
would bear something like a proportion
to the importance of the constituencies
called into play. In other words,
if the political axioms from which the
principle of an extended representation is
deduced have any foundation in reality,
it should follow that the most numerous
and most intelligent bodies of electors
would return to Parliament members of
the highest mark for character and capacity.
Now, looking at the condition of
the metropolitan representation as it
stands at present, or as it has stood any
time since the passing of the Reform Bill,
has this expectation been fulfilled? Lord
John Russell, the First Minister of the
Crown, sits, indeed, as member for the
city of London, and so far it is well.
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
as to the noble lord's capacity for government,
or whatever may be the views
of this or that political party, it is beyond
all dispute that, in such a case as this,
there is dignity and fitness in the relation
between the member and the constituency.
But, setting aside this one solitary instance,
with what metropolitan borough
is the name of any very eminent Englishman
associated at the present time? It is
of course as contrary to our inclination
as it would be unnecessary for the purposes
of the argument, to quote this or that
man's name as an actual illustration of the
failure of a system, or of the decadence
of a constituency. We would, however,
without any invidious or offensive personality,
invite attention to the present list
of metropolitan members, and ask what
name is to be found among them, with
the single exception we have named,
which is borne by a man with a shadow
of a pretension to be reckoned as among
the leading Englishmen of the age?"</p></blockquote>

<p>You see, Provost, I am by no
means singular in my estimate of the
quality of the metropolitan representatives.
The <cite>Times</cite> is with me, or
was with me twelve months ago; and
I suppose it will hardly be averred
that, since that time, any enormous
increase of wisdom or of ability has
been manifested by the gentlemen referred
to. But there is rather more
than this. In the article from which
I am quoting, the writer does not confine
his strictures simply to the metropolitan
boroughs. He goes a great deal
further, for he attacks large constituencies
in the mass, and points out
very well and forcibly the evils which
must inevitably follow should these
obtain an accession to their power.
Read, mark, and perpend the following
paragraphs, and then reconcile
their tenor&mdash;if you can&mdash;with the later
proposals from the same quarter for
the general suppression of small constituencies,
and the establishment of
larger tribunals of public opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lambeth, then, on the occasion of the
present election, is likely to become another
illustration of the downward tendencies
of the metropolitan constituencies.
We use the word 'tendency' advisedly,
for matters are worse than they have
been, and we can perceive no symptom of
a turning tide. Let us leave the names
of individuals aside, and simply consider
the metropolitan members as a body, and
what is their main employment in the
House of Commons? <em>Is it not mainly to
represent the selfish interests and blind prejudices
of the less patriotic or less enlightened
portion of their constituents whenever
any change is proposed manifestly for the
public benefit?</em> Looking at their votes,
one would suppose a metropolitan member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to be rather a Parliamentary agent
of the drovers, and sextons, and undertakers,
than a representative of one of
the most important constituencies in the
kingdom. Is this downward progress of
the metropolitan representation to remain
unchanged? Will it be extended to
other constituencies as soon as they shall
be brought under conditions analogous to
those under which the metropolitan electors
exercise the franchise? The question
is of no small interest. Whether the
fault be with the electors, or with those
who should have the nerve to come forward
and demand their suffrages, matters
not for the purposes of the argument.
The fact remains unaltered. Supposing
England throughout its area were represented
as the various boroughs of the metropolis
are represented at the present
time, what would be the effect? That is
the point for consideration. It may well
be that men of higher character, and of
more distinguished intellectual qualifications,
would readily attract the sympathies
and secure the votes of these constituencies;
but what does their absence prove?
<em>Simply that the same feeling of unwillingness
to face large electoral bodies, which is
said to prevail in the United States, is gradually
rising up in this country.</em> On the
other side of the Atlantic, we are told by
all who know the country best, that the
most distinguished citizens shrink from
stepping forward on the arena of public
life, lest they be made the mark for calumny
and abuse. It would require more
space than we can devote to the subject
to point out the correlative shortcomings
of the constituencies and the candidates;
but, leaving these aside, <em>we cannot but arrive
at the conclusion that there is something
in the constitution of these great electoral
masses which renders a peaceful majority
little better than a passive instrument
in the hands of a turbulent minority</em>, and
affords an explanation of the fact that
such a person as Mr Williams should
aspire to represent the borough of Lambeth."</p></blockquote>

<p>What do you think of that, Provost,
by way of an argument in favour
of large constituencies? I agree
with every word of it. I believe, in
common with the eloquent writer,
that matters are growing worse instead
of better, and that there is
something radically wrong in the constitution
of these great electoral
masses. I believe that they do not
represent the real intelligence of the
electors, and that they are liable to
all those objections which are here
so well and forcibly urged. It is
not necessary to travel quite so far
as London for an illustration. Look
at Glasgow. Have the twelve thousand
and odd electors of that great
commercial and manufacturing city
covered themselves with undying
glory by their choice of their present
representatives? Is the intelligence
of the first commercial city in Scotland
really embodied in the person of
Mr M'Gregor? I should be very loth
to think so. Far be it from me to
impugn the propriety of any particular
choice, or to speculate upon
coming events; but I cannot help
wondering whether, in the event of
the suppression of some of the smaller
burghs, and the transference of their
power to the larger cities, it may come
to pass that the city of St Mungo
shall be represented by the wisdom
of six M'Gregors? I repeat, that I
wish to say nothing in disparagement
of large urban constituencies, or of
their choice in any one particular
case&mdash;I simply desire to draw your
attention to the fact, that we are not
indebted to such constituencies for
returning the men who, by common
consent, are admitted to be the most
valuable members, in point of talent,
ability, and business habits, in the
House of Commons. How far we
should improve the character of our
legislative assembly, by disfranchising
smaller constituencies, and transferring
their privileges to the larger ones,&mdash;open
to such serious objections as
have been urged against them by the
<cite>Times</cite>, a journal not likely to err on the
side of undervaluing popular opinion&mdash;appears
to me a question decidedly
open to discussion; and I hope that
it will be discussed, pretty broadly
and extensively, before any active
steps are taken for suppressing
boroughs which are not open to the
charge of rank venality and corruption.</p>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite>, you observe, talks in
its more recent article, in which
totally opposite views are advocated,
of "stupid and corrupt little constituencies."
This is a clever way of
mixing up two distinct and separate
matters. We all know what is meant
by corruption, and I hope none of us
are in favour of it. It means the
purchase, either by money or promises,
of the suffrages of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
are intrusted with the electoral
franchise; and I am quite ready to
join with the <cite>Times</cite> in the most
hearty denunciation of such villanous
practices, whether used by Jew or
Gentile. It may be, and probably is,
impossible to prevent bribery altogether,
for there are scoundrels in all
constituencies; and if a candidate
with a long purse is so lax in his
morals as to hint at the purchase of
votes, he is tolerably certain to find a
market in which these commodities
are sold. But if, in any case, general
corruption can be proved against
a borough, it ought to be forthwith
disfranchised, and declared unworthy
of exercising so important a public
privilege. But of the "stupidity" of
constituencies, who are to be the
judges? Not, I hope, the Areopagites
of the <cite>Times</cite>, else we may
expect to see every constituency
which does not pronounce in favour
of Free Trade, placed under the
general extinguisher! Scarborough,
with some seven or eight hundred
electors&mdash;a good many more, by the
way, than are on the roll for the
Dreepdaily burghs&mdash;has, in the
opinion of the <cite>Times</cite>, stultified itself
for ever by returning Mr George F.
Young to Parliament, instead of a
Whig lordling, who possessed great
local influence. Therefore Scarborough
is put down in the black list,
not because it is "corrupt," but because
it is "stupid," in having elected
a gentleman of the highest political
celebrity, who is at the same time
one of the most extensive shipowners
of Great Britain! I put it to you,
Provost, whether this is not as cool
an instance of audacity as you ever
heard of. What would you think
if it were openly proposed, upon
our side, to disfranchise Greenwich,
because the tea-and-shrimp
population of that virtuous town has
committed the stupid act of returning
a Jew to Parliament? If stupidity is
to go for anything in the way of cancelling
privileges, I think I could
name to you some half-dozen places
on this side of the border which are
in evident danger, at least if we are
to accept the attainments of the
representatives as any test of the
mental acquirements of the electors;
but perhaps it is better to avoid
particulars in a matter so personal
and delicate.</p>

<p>I am not in the least degree surprised
to find the Free-Traders turning
round against the boroughs. Four
years ago, you would certainly have
laughed in the face of any one who
might have prophesied such a result;
but since then, times have altered.
The grand experiment upon native
industry has been made, and allowed
to go on without check or impediment.
The Free-Traders have had
it all their own way; and if there had
been one iota of truth in their statements,
or if their calculations had
been based upon secure and rational
data, they must long ago have
achieved a complete moral triumph.
Pray, remember what they told us.
They said that Free Trade in corn
and in cattle would not permanently
<em>lower</em> the value of agricultural produce
in Britain&mdash;it would only steady
prices, and prevent extreme fluctuations.
Then, again, we were assured
that large imports from any part of
the world could not by possibility
be obtained; and those consummate
blockheads, the statists, offered to
prove by figures, that a deluge of
foreign grain was as impossible as an
overflow of the Mediterranean. I
need not tell you that the results have
entirely falsified such predictions,
and that the agricultural interest has
ever since been suffering under the
effects of unexampled depression.
No man denies that. The stiffest
stickler for the cheap loaf does not
venture now to assert that agriculture
is a profitable profession in
Britain; all he can do is to recommend
economy, and to utter a hypocritical
prayer, that the prosperity which he
assumes to exist in other quarters
may, at no distant date, and through
some mysterious process which he
cannot specify, extend itself to the
suffering millions who depend for
their subsistence on the produce of the
soil of Britain, and who pay by far
the largest share of the taxes and
burdens of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Now, it is perfectly obvious that
agricultural distress, by which I mean
the continuance of a range of unremunerative
prices, cannot long prevail
in any district, without affecting the
traffic of the towns. You, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
an extensive retail merchant in Dreepdaily,
know well that the business of
your own trade depends in a great
degree upon the state of the produce
markets. So long as the farmer is
thriving, he buys from you and your
neighbours liberally, and you find
him, I have no doubt, your best and
steadiest customer. But if you reverse
his circumstances, you must
look for a corresponding change in
his dealings. He cannot afford to
purchase silks for his wife and
daughters, as formerly; he grows
penurious in his own personal expenditure,
and denies himself every unnecessary
luxury; he does nothing
for the good of trade, and is impassable
to all the temptations which
you endeavour to throw in his way.
To post your ledger is now no very
difficult task. You find last year's
stock remaining steadily on your
hands; and when the season for the
annual visit of the bagmen comes
round, you dismiss them from your premises
without gratifying their avidity
by an order. This is a faithful picture
of what has been going on for two
years, at least, in the smaller inland
boroughs. No doubt you are getting
your bread cheap; but those whose
importations have brought about that
cheapness, never were, and never can
be, customers of yours. Even supposing
that they were to take goods
in exchange for their imported grain,
no profit or custom could accrue to
the retail shopkeeper, who must
necessarily look to the people around
him for the consumption of his wares.
In this way trade has been made to
stagnate, and profits have of course
declined, until the tradesmen, weary
of awaiting the advent of a prosperity
which never arrives, have come to
the conclusion, that they will best
consult their interest by giving their
support to a policy the reverse of that
which has crippled the great body of
their customers.</p>

<p>Watering-places, and towns of
fashionable resort, have suffered in a
like degree. The gentry, whose rents
have been most seriously affected by
the unnatural diminution of prices,
are compelled to curtail their expenditure,
and to deny themselves many
things which formerly would have
been esteemed legitimate indulgences.
Economy is the order Of the day:
equipages are given up, servants dismissed,
and old furniture made to last
beyond its appointed time. These
things, I most freely admit, are no
great hardships to the gentry; nor do
I intend to awaken your compassion
in behalf of the squire, who, by reason
of his contracted rent-roll, has been
compelled to part with his carriage and
a couple of footmen, and to refuse his
wife and daughters the pleasure of a
trip to Cheltenham. The hardship
lies elsewhere. I pity the footmen,
the coach-builder, the upholsterer,
the house proprietor in Cheltenham,
and all the other people to whom the
surplus of the squire's revenue found
its way, much more than the old
gentleman himself. I daresay he is
quite as happy at home&mdash;perhaps far
happier&mdash;than if he were compelled
to racket elsewhere; and sure I am
that he will not consume his dinner
with less appetite because he lacks
the attendance of a couple of knaves,
with heads like full-blown cauliflowers.
But is it consistent with the workings
of human nature to expect that the
people to whom he formerly gave
employment and custom, let us say
to the extent of a couple of thousand
pounds, can be gratified by the cessation
of that expenditure?&mdash;or is it
possible to suppose that they will
remain enamoured of a system which
has caused them so heavy a loss?
View the subject in this light, and
you can have no difficulty in understanding
why this formidable reaction
has taken place in the English
boroughs. It is simply a question of
the pocket; and the electors now
see, that unless the boroughs are to
be left to rapid decay, something must
be done to protect and foster that
industry upon which they all depend.
Such facts, which are open and patent
to every man's experience, and tell
upon his income and expenditure, are
worth whole cargoes of theory. What
reason has the trader, whose stock is
remaining unsold upon his hands, to
plume himself, because he is assured
by Mr Porter, or some other similar
authority, that some hundred thousand
additional yards of flimsy calico have
been shipped from the British shores
in the course of the last twelve months?
So far as the shopkeeper is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the author of the <cite>Progress of the Nation</cite>
might as well have been reporting upon
the traffic-tables of Tyre and Sidon.
He is not even assured that all this
export has been accompanied with a
profit to the manufacturer. If he
reads the <cite>Economist</cite>, he will find that
exhilarating print filled with complaints
of general distress and want
of demand; he will be startled from
time to time by the announcement
that in some places, such as Dundee,
trade has experienced a most decided
check; or that in others, such as
Nottingham and Leicester, the operatives
are applying by hundreds for
admission to the workhouse! Comfortable
intelligence this, alongside of
increasing exports! But he has been
taught, to borrow a phrase from the
writings of the late John Galt, to
look upon your political arithmetician
as "a mystery shrouded by a halo;"
and he supposes that, somehow or
other, somebody must be the gainer
by all these exports, though it seems
clearly impossible to specify the
fortunate individual. However, this
he knows, to his cost any time these
three years back, that <em>he</em> has not been
the gainer; and, as he opines very
justly that charity begins at home,
and that the man who neglects the
interest of his own family is rather
worse than a heathen, he has made
up his mind to support such candidates
only as will stand by British
industry, and protect him by means
of protecting others. As for the men
of the maritime boroughs&mdash;a large and
influential class&mdash;I need not touch
upon their feelings or sentiments
with regard to Free Trade. I observe
that the Liberal press, with peculiar
taste and felicity of expression, designates
them by the generic term of
"crimps," just as it used to compliment
the whole agriculturists of
Britain by the comprehensive appellation
of "chawbacons." I trust they
feel the compliment so delicately conveyed;
but, after all, it matters little.
Hard words break no bones; and, in
the mean time at least, the vote of a
"crimp" is quite as good as that of
the concocter of a paragraph.</p>

<p>Perhaps now you understand why
the Free-Traders are so wroth against
the boroughs. They expected to
play off the latter against the county
constituencies; and, being disappointed
in that, they want to swamp
them altogether. This, I must own,
strikes me as particularly unfair. Let
it be granted that a large number of
the smaller boroughs did, at the last
general election, manifest a decided
wish that the Free Trade experiment,
then begun, should be allowed a fair
trial; are they to be held so pledged
to that commercial system, that,
however disastrous may have been
its results, they are not entitled to
alter their minds? Are all the representations,
promises, and prophecies
of the leading advocates of Free
Trade, to be set aside as if these
were never uttered or written? Who
were the cozeners in this case?
Clearly the men who boasted of the
enormous advantages which were
immediately to arise from their policy&mdash;advantages
whereof, up to the present
moment, not a single glimpse has
been vouchsafed. Free Trade, we
were distinctly told, was to benefit
the boroughs. Free Trade has done
nothing of the kind; on the contrary,
it has reduced their business and
lowered their importance. And now,
when this effect has become so plain
and undeniable that the very men
who subscribed to the funds of the
League, and who were foremost in
defending the conduct of the late Sir
Robert Peel, are sending Protectionists
to Parliament, it is calmly
proposed to neutralise their conversion
by depriving them of political
power!</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, I do not
know that the Free-Traders could have
hit upon a happier scheme. The grand
tendency of their system is centralisation.
They want to drive everything&mdash;paupers
alone excepted, if they
could by possibility compass that fortunate
immunity&mdash;into the larger
towns, which are the seats of export
manufacture, and to leave the rest of
the population to take care of themselves.
You see how they have succeeded
in Ireland, by the reports of
the last census. They are doing the
same thing in Scotland, as we shall
ere long discover to our cost; and,
indeed, the process is going on slowly,
but surely, throughout the whole of the
British islands. I chanced the other
day to light upon a passage in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
dreary article in the last number of
the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, which seems to
me to embody the chief economical
doctrines of the gentlemen to whom
we are indebted for the present posture
of affairs. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The common watchword, or cuckoo-note
of the advocates of restriction in
affairs of trade is, 'Protection to Native
Industry.' In the principle fairly involved
in this motto we cordially agree.
We are as anxious as the most vehement
advocate for high import duties on foreign
products can be, that the industry of our
fellow-countrymen should be protected(!)
We only differ as to the means. Their
theory of protection is to guard against
competition those branches of industry
which, without such extraneous help,
could never be successfully pursued:
ours, is that of enlarging, to the uttermost,
those other branches for the prosecution
of which our countrymen possess the
greatest aptitude, and of thereby securing
for their skill and capital the greatest
return. This protection is best afforded
by governments when they leave, without
interference, the productive industry
of the country to find its true level; for
we may be certain that the interest of
individuals will always lead them to prefer
those pursuits which they find most gainful.
There is, in fact, no mode of interference
with entire freedom of action
which must not be, in some degree, hurtful;
but <em>the mischief which follows upon
legislation in affairs of trade, in any given
country, is then most noxious when it tends
to foster branches of industry for which
other countries have a greater aptitude</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>You will, I think, find some difficulty
in discovering the protective
principle enunciated by this sagacious
scribe, who, like many others of his
limited calibre, is fain to take refuge
in nonsense when he cannot extricate
his meaning. You may also, very
reasonably, entertain doubts whether
the protective theory, which our friend
of the Blue and Yellow puts into the
mouth of his opponents, was ever
entertained or promulgated by any
rational being, at least in the broad
sense which he wishes to imply. The
true protective theory has reference to
the State burdens, which, in so far as
they are exacted from the produce of
native industry, or, in other words,
from labour, we wish to see counterbalanced
by a fair import-duty, which
shall reduce the foreign and the native
producer to an equality in the home
market. When the reviewer talks of
the non-interference of Government
with regard to the productive industry
of the country, he altogether omits
mention of that most stringent interference
which is the direct result of
taxation. If the farmer were allowed
to till the ground, to sow the seed,
and to reap the harvest, without any
interference from Government, then I
admit at once that a demand for protection
would be preposterous. But
when Government requires him to pay
income-tax, assessed taxes, church and
poor-rates, besides other direct burdens,
out of the fruit of his industry&mdash;when
it prevents him from growing on
his own land several kinds of crop,
in order that the customs revenue
may be maintained&mdash;when it taxes
indirectly his tea, coffee, wines, spirits,
tobacco, soap, and spiceries&mdash;then I
say that Government <em>does</em> interfere,
and that most unmercifully, with the
productive industry of the country.
Just suppose that, by recurring to a
primitive method of taxation, the
Government should lay claim to one-third
of the proceeds of every crop,
and instruct its emissaries to remove
it from the ground before another acre
should be reaped&mdash;would <em>that</em> not
constitute interference in the eyes of
the sapient reviewer? Well, then,
since all taxes must ultimately be paid
out of produce, what difference does
the mere method of levying the burden
make with regard to the burden
itself? I call your attention to this
point, because the Free-Traders invariably,
but I fear wilfully, omit all
mention of artificial taxation when
they talk of artificial restrictions.
They want you to believe that we,
who maintain the opposite view, seek
to establish an entire monopoly in
Great Britain of all kinds of possible
produce; and they are in the habit of
putting asinine queries as to the propriety
of raising the duties on foreign
wine, so as to encourage the establishment
of vineyards in Kent and Sussex,
and also as to the proper protective
duty which should be levied on
pine-apples, in order that a due stimulus
may be given to the cultivation of
that luscious fruit. But these funny fellows
take especial care never to hint to
you that protection is and was demanded
simply on account of the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
nature of our imposts, which have the
effect of raising the rates of labour.
It is in this way, and no other, that
agriculture, deprived of protection,
but still subjected to taxation, has
become an unremunerative branch of
industry; and you observe how calmly
the disciple of Ricardo condemns it to
destruction. "The mischief," quoth
he, "which follows upon legislation
in affairs of trade, in any given
country, is then most noxious when
it tends to foster branches of industry
for which other countries have a
greater aptitude." So, then, having
taxed agriculture to that point when
it can no longer bear the burden, we
are, for the future, to draw our supplies
from "other countries which
have a greater aptitude" for growing
corn; that aptitude consisting in their
comparative immunity from taxation,
and in the degraded moral and social
condition of the serfs who constitute
the tillers of the soil! We are to
give up cultivation, and apply ourselves
to the task "of enlarging to
the uttermost those other branches,
for the prosecution of which our
countrymen possess the greatest aptitude"&mdash;by
which, I presume, is meant
the manufacture of cotton-twist!</p>

<p>Now, then, consider for a moment
what is the natural, nay, the inevitable
effect of this narrowing of the
range of employment. I shall not
start the important point whether the
concentration of labour does not tend
to lower wages&mdash;I shall merely assume,
what is indeed already abundantly established
by facts, that the depression
of agriculture in any district leads almost
immediately to a large increase
in the population of the greater towns.
Places like Dreepdaily may remain stationary,
but they do not receive any
material increment to their population.
You have, I believe, no export trade,
at least very little, beyond the manufacture
of an ingenious description of
snuff-box, justly prized by those who
are in the habit of stimulating their
nostrils. The displaced stream of
labour passes through you, but does
not tarry with you&mdash;it rolls on towards
Paisley and Glasgow, where it is
absorbed in the living ocean. Year
after year the same process is carried
on. The older people, probably because
it is not worth while at their
years to attempt a change, tarry in
their little villages and cots, and gradually
acquire that appearance of
utter apathy, which is perhaps the
saddest aspect of humanity. The
younger people, finding no employment
at home, repair to the towns,
marry or do worse, and propagate
children for the service of the
factories which are dedicated to the
export trade. Of education they receive
little or nothing; for they must
be in attendance on their gaunt iron
master during the whole of their
waking hours; and religion seeks after
them in vain. What wonder, then,
if the condition of our operatives
should be such as to suggest to
thinking minds very serious doubts
whether our boasted civilisation can
be regarded in the light of a blessing?
Certain it is that the bulk of these
classes are neither better nor happier
than their forefathers. Nay, if there
be any truth in evidence&mdash;any reality
in the appalling accounts which reach
us from the heart of the towns, there
exists an amount of crime, misery,
drunkenness, and profligacy, which is
unknown even among savages and
heathen nations. Were we to recall
from the four ends of the earth all
the missionaries who have been despatched
from the various churches,
they would find more than sufficient
work ready for them at home. Well-meaning
men project sanitary improvements,
as if these could avail to
counteract the moral poison. New
churches are built; new schools are
founded; public baths are subscribed
for, and public washing-houses are
opened; the old rookeries are pulled
down, and light and air admitted to
the heart of the cities&mdash;but the heart
of the people is not changed; and
neither air nor water, nor religious
warning, has the effect of checking
crime, eradicating intemperance, or
teaching man the duty which he owes
to himself, his brethren, and his God!
This is an awful picture, but it is a
true one; and it well becomes us to
consider why these things should be.
There is no lukewarmness on the subject
exhibited in any quarter. The
evil is universally acknowledged, and
every one would be ready to contribute
to alleviate it, could a proper
remedy be suggested. It is not my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
province to suggest remedies; but it
does appear to me that the original
fault is to be found in the system
which has caused this unnatural pressure
of our population into the towns.
I am aware that in saying this, I am
impugning the leading doctrines of
modern political economy. I am
aware that I am uttering what will
be considered by many as a rank
political heresy; still, not having the
fear of fire and fagot before my eyes,
I shall use the liberty of speech. It
appears to me that the system which
has been more or less adopted since
the days of Mr Huskisson, of suppressing
small trades for the encouragement
of foreign importation, and of
stimulating export manufactures to
the uttermost, has proved very pernicious
to the morals and the social
condition of the people. The termination
of the war found us with a
large population, and with an enormous
debt. If, on the one hand, it
was for the advantage of the country
that commerce should progress
with rapid strides, and that our
foreign trade should be augmented,
it was, on the other, no less necessary
that due regard should be had for the
former occupations of the people, and
that no great and violent displacements
of labour should be occasioned,
by fiscal relaxations which might
have the effect of supplanting home
industry by foreign produce in the
British market. The mistake of the
political economists lies in their obstinate
determination to enforce a
principle, which in the abstract is
not only unobjectionable but unchallenged,
without any regard whatever
to the peculiar and pecuniary circumstances
of the country. They will
not look at what has gone before, in
order to determine their line of conduct
in any particular case. They
admit of no exceptions. They start
with their axiom that trade ought to
be free, and they will not listen to
any argument founded upon special
circumstances in opposition to that
doctrine. Now, this is not the way
in which men have been, or ever can
be, governed. They must be dealt
with as rational beings, not regarded
as mere senseless machinery, which
may be treated as lumber, and cast
aside to make way for some new
improvement. Look at the case of
our own Highlanders. We know
very well that, from the commencement
of the American war, it was
considered by the British Government
an important object to maintain
the population of the Highlands, as
the source from which they drew
their hardiest and most serviceable
recruits. So long as the manufacture
of kelp existed, and the breeding of
cattle was profitable, there was little
difficulty in doing this; now, under
this new commercial system, we are
told that the population is infinitely
too large for the natural resources of
the country; we are shocked by
accounts of periodical famine, and of
deaths occurring from starvation;
and our economists declare that there
is no remedy except a general emigration
of the inhabitants. This is
the extreme case in Great Britain;
but extreme cases often furnish us
with the best tests of the operation
of a particular system. Here you
have a population fostered for an
especial purpose, and abandoned so
soon as that special purpose has been
served. Without maintaining that
the Gael is the most industrious of
mankind, it strikes me forcibly that
it would be a better national policy
to give every reasonable encouragement
to the development of the
natural resources of that portion of
the British islands, than to pursue the
opposite system, and to reduce the
Highlands to a wilderness. Not so
think the political economists. They
can derive their supplies cheaper
from elsewhere, at the hands of
strangers who contribute no share
whatever to the national revenue;
and for the sake of that cheapness
they are content to reduce thousands
of their countrymen to beggary.
But emigration cannot, and will not,
be carried out to an extent at all
equal to the necessity which is engendered
by the cessation of employment.
The towns become the great
centre-points and recipients of the
displaced population; and so centralisation
goes on, and, as a matter of
course, pauperism and crime increase.</p>

<p>To render this system perpetual,
without any regard to ultimate consequences,
is the leading object of the
Free-Traders. Not converted, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
on the contrary rendered more inveterate
by the failure of their schemes,
they are determined to allow no consideration
whatever to stand in the
way of their purpose; and of this you
have a splendid instance in their late
denunciation of the boroughs. They
think&mdash;whether rightfully or wrongfully,
it is not now necessary to
inquire&mdash;that, by altering the proportions
of Parliamentary power as
established by the Reform Act&mdash;by
taking away from the smaller
boroughs, and by adding to the
urban constituencies, they will still
be able to command a majority in
the House of Commons. In the present
temper of the nation, and so
long as its voice is expressed as heretofore,
they know, feel, and admit
that their policy is not secure. And
why is it not secure? Simply because
it has undergone the test of experience&mdash;because
it has had a fair trial
in the sight of the nation&mdash;and because
it has not succeeded in realising
the expectations of its founders.</p>

<p>I have ventured to throw together
these few crude remarks for your consideration
during the recess, being
quite satisfied that you will not feel
indifferent upon any subject which
touches the dignity, status, or privileges
of the boroughs. Whether Lord
John Russell agrees with the <cite>Times</cite> as
to the mode of effecting the threatened
Parliamentary change, or whether
he has some separate scheme of his
own, is a question which I cannot
solve. Possibly he has not yet made
up his mind as to the course which it
may be most advisable to pursue;
for, in the absence of anything like
general excitement or agitation, it is
not easy to predict in what manner
the proposal for any sweeping or
organic change may be received by
the constituencies of the Empire.
There is far too much truth in the
observations which I have already
quoted from the great leading journal,
relative to the dangers which must
attend an increase of constituencies
already too large, or a further extension
of their power, to permit of our
considering this as a light and unimportant
matter. I view it as a very
serious one indeed; and I cannot help
thinking that Lord John Russell has
committed an act of gross and unjustifiable
rashness, in pledging himself,
at the present time, to undertake a remodelment
of the constitution. But
whatever he does, I hope, for his own
sake, and for the credit of the Liberal
party, that he will be able to assign
some better and more constitutional
reason for the change, than the refusal
of the English boroughs to bear arms
in the crusade which is directed
against the interests of Native Industry.</p>

<h2><small>PARIS IN 1851.</small>&mdash;(<em>Continued.</em>)</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Opera.</span>&mdash;In the evening I
went to the French Opera, which is
still one of the lions of Paris. It was
once in the Rue Richelieu; but the
atrocious assassination of the Duc de
Berri, who was stabbed in its porch,
threw a kind of horror over the spot:
the theatre was closed, and the performance
moved to its present site in
the Rue Lepelletier, a street diverging
from the Boulevard.</p>

<p>Fond as the French are of decoration,
the architecture of this building
possesses no peculiar beauty, and
would answer equally well for a substantial
public hospital, a workhouse,
or a barrack, if the latter were not the
more readily suggested by the gendarmerie
loitering about the doors,
and the mounted dragoons at either
end of the street.</p>

<p>The passages of the interior are of
the same character&mdash;spacious and
substantial; but the door of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</i>
opens, and the stranger, at a single
step, enters from those murky passages
into all the magic of a crowded
theatre. The French have, within
these few years, borrowed from us the
art of lighting theatres. I recollect
the French theatre lighted only by
a few lamps scattered round the
house, or a chandelier in the middle,
which might have figured in the crypt
of a cathedral. This they excused,
as giving greater effect to the stage;
but it threw the audience into utter
gloom. They have now made the
audience a part of the picture, and
an indispensable part. The opera-house
now shows the audience; and
if not very dressy, or rather as dowdy,
odd, and dishevelled a crowd as I ever
recollect to have seen within theatrical
walls, yet they are evidently
human beings, which is much more
picturesque than masses of spectres,
seen only by an occasional flash from
the stage.</p>

<p>The French architects certainly
have not made this national edifice
grand; but they have made it a much
better thing,&mdash;lively, showy, and rich.
Neither majestic and monotonous,
nor grand and Gothic, they have
made it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riant</i> and racy, like a place
where men and women come to be
happy, where beautiful dancers are
to be seen, and where sweet songs are
to be heard, and where the mind is
for three or four hours to forget all
its cares, and to carry away pleasant
recollections for the time being. From
pit to ceiling it is covered with paintings&mdash;all
sorts of cupids, nymphs, and
flower-garlands, and Greek urns&mdash;none
of them wonders of the pencil,
but all exhibiting that showy mediocrity
of which every Frenchman
is capable, and with which every
Frenchman is in raptures. All looks
rich, warm, and <em>operatic</em>.</p>

<p>One characteristic change has
struck me everywhere in Paris&mdash;the
men dress better, and the women
worse. When I was last here, the
men dressed half bandit and half Hottentot.
The revolutionary mystery
was at work, and the hatred of the
Bourbons was emblematised in a conical
hat, a loose neckcloth, tremendous
trousers, and the scowl of a stage
conspirator. The Parisian men have
since learned the decencies of <em>dress</em>.</p>

<p>As I entered the house before the
rising of the curtain, I had leisure to
look about me, and I found even in
the audience a strong contrast to
those of London. By that kind of
contradiction to everything rational
and English which governs the Parisian,
the women seem to choose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dishabille</i>
for the Opera.</p>

<p>As the house was crowded, and the
boxes are let high, and the performance
of the night was popular, I
might presume that some of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i>
were present, yet I never saw so
many <em>ill-dressed</em> women under one
roof. Bonnets, shawls, muffles of all
kinds, were the <em>costume</em>. How different
from the finish, the splendour,
and the <em>fashion</em> of the English opera-box.
I saw hundreds of women who
appeared, by their dress, scarcely
above the rank of shopkeepers, yet,
who probably were among the Parisian
leaders of fashion, if in republican
Paris there are <em>any</em> leaders of
fashion.</p>

<p>But I came to be interested, to enjoy,
to indulge in a feast of music and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
acting; with no fastidiousness of criticism,
and with every inclination to
be gratified. In the opera itself I was
utterly disappointed. The Opera was
<em>Zerline</em>, or, <em>The Basket of Oranges</em>.
The composer was the first living
musician of France, Auber; the writer
was the most popular dramatist of his
day, Scribe; the Prima Donna was
Alboni, to whom the manager of the
Opera in London had not thought it
too much to give £4000 for a single
season. I never paid my francs with
more willing expectation: and I never
saw a performance of which I so soon
got weary.</p>

<p>The plot is singularly trifling. Zerline,
an orange-girl of Palermo, has
had a daughter by Boccanera, a man
of rank, who afterwards becomes
Viceroy of Sicily. Zerline is captured
by pirates, and carried to Algiers.
The opera opens with her return to
Palermo, after so many years that
her daughter is grown up to womanhood;
and Boccanera is emerged into
public life, and has gradually became
an officer of state.</p>

<p>The commencing scene has all the
animation of the French picturesque.
The Port of Palermo is before the
spectator; the location is the Fruit
Market. Masses of fruits, with smart
peasantry to take care of them, cover
the front of the stage. The background
is filled up with Lazzaroni
lying on the ground, sleeping, or eating
macaroni. The Prince Boccanera
comes from the palace; the crowd
observe 'Son air sombre;' the Prince
sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On a most unlucky day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Satan threw her in my way;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I the princess took to wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now the torture of my life," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this matrimonial confession,
which extends to details, the prime
minister tells us of his love still existing
for Zerline, whose daughter he
has educated under the name of niece,
and who is now the Princess Gemma,
and about to be married to a court
noble.</p>

<p>A ship approaches the harbour;
Boccanera disappears; the Lazzaroni
hasten to discharge the cargo. Zerline
lands from the vessel, and sings a
cavatina in praise of Palermo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Palerme! O Sicile!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beau ciel, plaine fertile!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Zerline is a dealer in oranges, and
she lands her cargo, placing it in the
market. The original tenants of the
place dispute her right to come among
them, and are about to expel her by
force, when a marine officer, Rodolf,
takes her part, and, drawing his
sword, puts the whole crowd to flight.
Zerline, moved by this instance of heroism,
tells him her story, that she
was coming "un beau matin" to the
city to sell oranges, when a pitiless
corsair captured her, and carried her
to Africa, separating her from her
child, whom she had not seen for fifteen
years; that she escaped to
Malta, laid in a stock of oranges there;&mdash;and
thus the events of the day occurred.
Rodolf, this young hero, is costumed
in a tie-wig with powder, stiff
skirts, and the dress of a century ago.
What tempted the author to put not
merely his hero, but all his court characters,
into the costume of Queen
Anne, is not easily conceivable, as
there is nothing in the story which
limits it in point of time.</p>

<p>Zerline looks after him with sudden
sympathy, says that she heard him
sigh, that he must be unhappy, and
that, if her daughter lives, he is just
the <em>husband</em> for her,&mdash;Zerline not having
been particular as to marriage
herself. She then rambles about the
streets, singing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Achetez mes belles oranges,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Des fruits divins, des fruits exquis;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Des oranges comme les anges<br /></span>
<span class="i1">N'en <em>goutent pas en Paradis</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this "hommage aux oranges!"
to the discredit of Paradise, on which
turns the plot of the play, a succession
of maids of honour appear, clad
in the same unfortunate livery of fardingales,
enormous flat hats, powdered
wigs, and stomachers. The
Princess follows them, apparently
armed by her costume against all the
assaults of Cupid. But she, too, has an
"affaire du c&oelig;ur" upon her hands. In
fact, from the Orangewoman up to
the Throne, Cupid is the Lord of Palermo,
with its "beau ciel, plaine fertile."
The object of the Princess's
love is the Marquis de Buttura, the
suitor of her husband's supposed
niece. Here is a complication! The
enamoured wife receives a billet-doux
from the suitor, proposing a meeting
on his return from hunting. She tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the billet for the purpose of concealment,
and in her emotion drops the fragments
on the floor. That billet performs
all important part in the end. The
enamoured lady buys an orange, and
gives a gold piece for it. Zerline, not
accustomed to be so well paid for her
fruit, begins to suspect this outrageous
liberality; and having had experience
in these matters, picks up the fragments
of the letter, and gets into the
whole secret.</p>

<p>The plot proceeds: the daughter
of the orangewoman now appears.
She is clad in the same preposterous
habiliments. As the niece of the minister,
she is created a princess, (those
things are cheap in Italy,) and she,
too, is in love with the officer in the
tie-wig. She recognises the song of
Zerline, "Achetez mes belles oranges,"
and sings the half of it. On this, the
mother and daughter now recognise
each other. It is impossible to go
further in such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i>. If
Italian operas are proverbially silly,
we are to recollect that this is not an
Italian, but a French one; and that
it is by the most popular comic writer
of France.</p>

<p>The marriage of Gemma and Rodolf
is forbidden by the pride of the
King's sister, the wife of Boccanera,
but Zerline interposes, reminds her of
the orange <em>affair</em>, threatens her with
the discovery of the billet-doux, and
finally makes her give her consent:
and thus the curtain drops. I grew
tired of all this insipidity, and left
the theatre before the catastrophe.
The music seemed to me fitting for
the plot&mdash;neither better nor worse;
and I made my escape with right
good-will from the clamour and crash
of the orchestra, and from the loves
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> of the belles of Palermo.</p>

<p><em>The Obelisk.</em>&mdash;I strayed into the
Place de la Concorde, beyond comparison
the finest <em>space</em> in Paris.
I cannot call it a square, nor does
it equal in animation the Boulevard;
but in the <em>profusion</em> of noble architecture
it has no rival in Paris, nor
in Europe. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Despotisme!</i>
every inch of it is owing to Monarchy.
Republics build nothing, if we except
prisons and workhouses. They are proverbially
squalid, bitter, and beggarly.
What has America, with all her boasting,
ever built, but a warehouse or a
conventicle? The Roman Republic,
after seven hundred years' existence,
remained a collection hovels till an
Emperor faced them with marble. If
Athens exhibited her universal talents
in the splendour of her architecture,
we must recollect that Pericles was
her <em>master</em> through life&mdash;as substantially
<em>despotic</em>, by the aid of the
populace, as an Asiatic king by
his guards; and recollect, also, that
an action of damages was brought
against him for "wasting the public
money on the Parthenon," the glory
of Athens in every succeeding age.
Louis Quatorze, Napoleon, and Louis
Philippe&mdash;two openly, and the third
secretly, as despotic as the Sultan&mdash;were
the true builders of Paris.</p>

<p>As I stood in the centre of this
vast enclosure, I was fully struck
with the effect of <em>scene</em>. The sun
was sinking into a bed of gold and
crimson clouds, that threw their hue
over the long line of the Champs
Elysées. Before me were the two
great fountains, and the Obelisk of
Luxor. The fountains had ceased to
play, from the lateness of the hour,
but still looked massive and gigantic;
the obelisk looked shapely and superb.
The gardens of the Tuilleries were on
my left&mdash;deep dense masses of foliage,
surmounted in the distance by the tall
roofs of the old Palace; on my right,
the verdure of the Champs Elysées,
with the Arc de l'Etoile rising above
it, at the end of its long and noble
avenue; in my front the Palace of
the Legislature, a chaste and elegant
structure; and behind me, glowing
in the sunbeams, the Madeleine, the
noblest church&mdash;I think the noblest
edifice, in Paris, and perhaps not surpassed
in beauty and grandeur, for
its size, by any place of worship in
Europe. The air cool and sweet from
the foliage, the vast <em>place</em> almost
solitary, and undisturbed by the cries
which are incessant in this babel
during the day, yet with that gentle
confusion of sounds which makes
the murmur and the music of a great
city. All was calm, noble, and
soothing.</p>

<p>The obelisk of Luxor which stands
in the centre of the "Place," is one
of two Monoliths, or pillars of a
single stone, which, with Cleopatra's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Needle, were given by Mehemet Ali
to the French, at the time when, by
their alliance, he expected to have
made himself independent. All the
dates of Egyptian antiquities are uncertain&mdash;notwithstanding
Young and
his imitator Champollion&mdash;but the
date <em>assigned</em> to this pillar is 1550
years before the Christian era. The
two obelisks stood in front of the
great temple of Thebes, now named
Luxor, and the hieroglyphics which
cover this one, from top to bottom, are
supposed to relate the exploits and
incidents of the reign of Sesostris.</p>

<p>It is of red Syenite; but, from time
and weather, it is almost the colour of
limestone. It has an original flaw up
a third of its height, for which the
Egyptian masons provided a remedy
by wedges, and the summit is slightly
broken. The height of the monolith
is seventy-two feet three inches,
which would look insignificant, fixed
as it is in the centre of lofty buildings,
but for its being raised on a
plinth of granite, and that again
raised on a pedestal of immense
blocks of granite&mdash;the height of the
plinth and the pedestal together being
twenty-seven feet, making the entire
height nearly one hundred. The weight
of the monolith is five hundred thousand
pounds; the weight of the pedestal
is half that amount, and the weight of
the blocks probably makes the whole
amount to nine hundred thousand,
which is the weight of the obelisk at
Rome. It was erected in 1836, by
drawing it up an inclined plane of masonry,
and then raising it by cables and
capstans to the perpendicular. The
operation was tedious, difficult, and
expensive; but it was worth the
labour; and the monolith now forms
a remarkable monument of the zeal
of the king, and of the liberality of
his government.</p>

<p>There is, I understand, an obelisk
remaining in Egypt, which was given
by the Turkish government to the
British army, on the expulsion of the
French from Egypt, but which has
been unclaimed, from the difficulty of
carrying it to England.</p>

<p>That difficulty, it must be acknowledged,
is considerable. In transporting
and erecting the obelisk of Luxor
six years were employed. I have not
heard the expense, but it must have
been large. A vessel was especially
constructed at Toulon, for its conveyance
down the Nile. A long
road was to be made from the Nile to
the Temple. Then the obelisk required
to be protected from the accidents
of carriage, which was done by
enclosing it in a wooden case. It was
then drawn by manual force to
the river&mdash;and this employed three
months. Then came the trouble of
embarking it, for which the vessel
had to be nearly sawn through; then
came the crossing of the bar at
Rosetta&mdash;a most difficult operation at
the season of the year; then the
voyage down the Mediterranean, the
vessel being towed by a steamer; then
the landing at Cherbourg, in 1833;
and, lastly, the passage up the Seine,
which occupied nearly four months,
reaching Paris in December; thenceforth
its finishing and erection, which
was completed only in three years
after.</p>

<p>This detail may have some interest,
as we have a similar project before
us. But the whole question is,
whether the transport of the obelisk
which remains in Egypt for us is
worth the expense. We, without
hesitation, say that it <em>is</em>. The French
have shown that it is <em>practicable</em>, and
it is a matter of <em>rational</em> desire to
show that we are not behind the
French either in power, in ability, or
in zeal, to adorn our cities. The
obelisk transported to England would
be a proud monument, without being
an offensive one, of a great achievement
of our armies; it would present
to our eyes, and those of our children,
a relic of the most civilised kingdom of
the early ages; it would sustain the
recollections of the scholar by its
record, and might kindle the energy
of the people by the sight of what
had been accomplished by the prowess
of Englishmen.</p>

<p>If it be replied that such views are
Utopian, may we not ask, what is
the use of all antiquity, since we can
eat and drink as well without it?
But we cannot <em>feel</em> as loftily without
it; many a lesson of vigour, liberality,
and virtue would be lost to us without
it; we should lose the noblest examples
of the arts, some of the finest
displays of human genius in architecture,
a large portion of the teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the public mind in all things great, and
an equally large portion of the incentives
to public virtue in all things
self-denying. The labour, it is true,
of conveying the obelisk would be
serious, the expense considerable, and
we might not see it erected before the
gate of Buckingham Palace these ten
years. But it would be erected at
<em>last</em>. It would be a trophy&mdash;it would
be an abiding memorial of the extraordinary
country from which civilisation
spread to the whole world.</p>

<p>But the two grand fountains ought
especially to stimulate our emulation.
Those we can have without a voyage
from Alexandria to Portsmouth, or a
six years' delay.</p>

<p>The fountains of the Place de la
Concorde would deserve praise if it
were only for their beauty. At a
distance sufficient for the picturesque,
and with the sun shining on them,
they actually look like domes and
cataracts of molten silver; and a
nearer view does not diminish their
right to admiration. They are both
lofty, perhaps, fifty feet high, both
consisting of three basins, lessening
in size in proportion to their height,
and all pouring out sheets of water
from the trumpets of Tritons, from
the mouths of dolphins, and from
allegorical figures. One of those
fountains is in honour of Maritime
Navigation, and the other of the
Navigation of Rivers. In the former
the figures represent the Ocean and
the Mediterranean, with the Genii
of the fisheries; and in the upper
basin are Commerce, Astronomy,
Navigation, &amp;c., all capital bronzes,
and all spouting out floods of water.
The fountain of River Navigation is
not behind its rival in bronze or
water. It exhibits the Rhine and the
Rhone, with the Genii of fruits and
flowers, of the vintage and the harvest,
with the usual attendance of
Tritons. Why the artist had no room
for the Seine and the Garonne, while
he introduced the Rhine, which is not
a French river in any part of its
course, must be left for his explanation;
but the whole constitutes a
beautiful and magnificent object, and,
with the sister fountain, perhaps
forms the finest display of the kind in
Europe. I did not venture, while
looking at those stately monuments
of French art, to turn my thoughts to
our own unhappy performances in
Trafalgar Square&mdash;the rival of a
soda-water bottle, yet the work of a
people of boundless wealth, and the
first machinists in the world.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">The Jardin des Plantes.</i>&mdash;I found
this fine establishment crowded with
the lower orders&mdash;fathers and mothers,
nurses, old women, and soldiers. As
it includes the popular attractions of a
zoological garden, as well as a botanical,
every day sees its visitants, and
every holiday its crowds. The plants
are for science, and for that I had no
time, even had I possessed other
qualifications; but the zoological collection
were for curiosity, and of that
the spectators had abundance. Yet
the animals of pasture appeared to be
languid, possibly tired of the perpetual
bustle round them&mdash;for all animals
love quiet at certain times, and escape
from the eye of man, when escape is
in their power. Possibly the heat of
the weather, for the day was remarkably
sultry, might have contributed
to their exhaustion. But if they have
memory&mdash;and why should they not?&mdash;they
must have strangely felt the
contrast of their free pastures, shady
woods, and fresh streams, with the
little patch of ground, the parched
soil, and the clamour of ten thousand
tongues round them. I could imagine
the antelope's intelligent eye, as he
lay panting before us on his brown
patch of soil, comparing it with the
ravines of the Cape, or the eternal
forests clothing the hills of his native
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>But the object of all popular interest
was the pit of the bears;
there the crowd was incessant and
delighted. But the bears, three or
four huge brown beasts, by no means
<em>reciprocated</em> the popular feeling. They
sat quietly on their hind-quarters,
gazing grimly at the groups which
lined their rails, and tossed cakes and
apples to them from above. They
had probably been saturated with
sweets, for they scarcely noticed anything
but by a growl. They were
insensible to apples&mdash;even oranges
could not make them move, and cakes
they seemed to treat with scorn. It
was difficult to conceive that those
heavy and unwieldy-looking animals
could be ferocious; but the Alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
hunter knows that they are as fierce
as the tiger, and nearly as quick and
dangerous in their spring.</p>

<p>The carnivorous beasts were few,
and, except in the instance of one
lion, of no remarkable size or beauty.
As they naturally doze during the
day, their languor was no proof of
their weariness; but I have never
seen an exhibition of this kind without
some degree of regret. The plea
of the promotion of science is nothing.
Even if it were important to science
to be acquainted with the habits of
the lion and tiger, which it is not,
their native habits are not to be
learned from the animal shut up in a
cage. The chief exertion of their
sagacity and their strength in the
native state is in the pursuit of prey;
yet what of these can be learned from
the condition in which the animal
dines as regularly as his keeper, and
divides his time between feeding and
sleep? Half-a-dozen lions let loose in
the Bois de Boulogne would let the
naturalist into more knowledge of their
nature than a menagerie for fifty years.</p>

<p>The present system is merely
cruel; and the animals, without exercise,
without air, without the common
excitement of free motion, which all
animals enjoy so highly&mdash;perhaps
much more highly than the human
race&mdash;fall into disease and die, no
doubt miserably, though they cannot
draw up a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rationale</i> of their sufferings.
I have been told that the lions
in confinement die chiefly of consumption&mdash;a
singularly sentimental disease
for this proud ravager of the desert.
But the whole purpose of display
would be answered as effectually by
exhibiting half-a-dozen lions' <em>skins</em>
stuffed, in the different attitudes of
seizing their prey, or ranging the
forest, or feeding. At present nothing
is seen but a great beast asleep,
or restlessly moving in a space of
half-a-dozen square feet, and pining
away in his confinement. An eagle
on his perch and with a chain on his
leg, in a menagerie, always appears
to me like a dethroned monarch; and
I have never seen him thus cast down
from his "high estate" without longing
to break his chain, and let him
spread his wing, and delight his
splendid eye with the full view of his
kingdom of the Air.</p>

<p>The Jardin dates its origin as far
back as Louis XIII., when the king's
physician recommended its foundation
for science. The French are
fond of gardening, and are good gardeners;
and the climate is peculiarly
favourable to flowers, as is evident
from the market held every morning
in summer by the side of the Madeleine,
where the greatest abundance
of the richest flowers I ever saw is
laid out for the luxury of the Parisians.</p>

<p>The Jardin, patronised by kings
and nobles, flourished through successive
reigns; but the appointment
of Buffon, about the middle of the
eighteenth century, suddenly raised it
to the pinnacle of European celebrity.
The most eloquent writer of his time,
(in the style which the French call
eloquence,) a man of family, and a
man of opulence, he made Natural
History the <em>fashion</em>, and in France
that word is magic. It accomplishes
everything&mdash;it includes everything.
All France was frantic with the study
of plants, animals, poultry-yards, and
projects for driving tigers in cabriolets,
and harnessing lions <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Cybele</i>.</p>

<p>But Buffon mixed good sense with
his inevitable <em>charlatanrie</em>&mdash;he selected
the ablest men whom he could
find for his professors; and in France
there is an extraordinary quantity of
"ordinary" cleverness&mdash;they gave
amusing lectures, and they won the
hearts of the nation.</p>

<p>But the Revolution came, and
crushed all institutions alike. Buffon,
fortunate in every way, had died in
the year before, in 1788, and was thus
spared the sight of the general ruin.
The Jardin escaped, through some
plea of its being national property;
but the professors had fled, and were
starving, or starved.</p>

<p>The Consulate, and still more the
Empire, restored the establishment.
Napoleon was ambitious of the character
of a man of science, he was a
member of the Institute, he knew the
French character, and he flattered the
national vanity, by indulging it with
the prospect of being at the head of
human knowledge.</p>

<p>The institution had by this time
been so long regarded as a public
show that it was beginning to be
regarded as nothing else. Gratuitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
lectures, which are always good for
nothing, and to which all kinds of
people crowd with corresponding profit,
were gradually reducing the character
of the Jardin; when Cuvier,
a man of talent, was appointed to one
of the departments of the institution,
and he instantly revived its popularity;
and, what was of more importance,
its public use.</p>

<p>Cuvier devoted himself to comparative
anatomy and geology. The
former was a study within human
means, of which he had the materials
round him, and which, being intended
for the instruction of man, is evidently
intended for his investigation.
The latter, in attempting to fix the
age of the world, to decide on the
process of creation, and to contradict
Scripture by the ignorance of man,
is merely an instance of the presumption
of <em>Sciolism</em>. Cuvier exhibited
remarkable dexterity in discovering
the species of the fossil fishes, reptiles,
and animals. The science was
not new, but he threw it into a new
form&mdash;he made it interesting, and he
made it probable. If a large proportion
of his supposed discoveries were
merely ingenious guesses, they were
at least guesses which there was nobody
to refute, and they <em>were ingenious</em>&mdash;that
was enough. Fame followed
him, and the lectures of the
ingenious theorist were a popular
novelty. The "Cabinet of Comparative
Anatomy" in the Jardin is the
monument of his diligence, and it
does honour to the sagacity of his
investigation.</p>

<p>One remark, however, must be
made. On a former visit to the
Cabinet of Comparative Anatomy,
among the collection of skeletons, I
was surprised and disgusted with the
sight of the skeleton of the Arab who
killed General Kleber in Egypt. The
Arab was impaled, and the iron spike
was shown <em>still sticking in the</em> spine!
I do not know whether this hideous
object is still to be seen, for I have not
lately visited the apartment; but, if
existing still, it ought to remain no
longer in a museum of science. Of
course, the assassin deserved death;
but, in all probability, the murder
which made him guilty, was of the
same order as that which made Charlotte
Corday famous. How many of his
countrymen had died by the soldiery
of France! In the eye of Christianity,
this is no palliation; though in the
eye of Mahometanism it might constitute
a patriot and a hero. At all
events, so frightful a spectacle ought
<em>not</em> to meet the public eye.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel des Invalides.</i>&mdash;The depository
of all that remains of Napoleon,
the monument of almost two hundred
years of war, and the burial-place
of a whole host of celebrated
names, is well worth the visit of
strangers; and I entered the esplanade
of the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel</i> with due veneration,
and some slight curiosity to see
the changes of time. I had visited
this noble pile immediately after the
fall of Napoleon, and while it still
retained the honours of an imperial
edifice. Its courts now appeared to
me comparatively desolate; this, however,
may be accounted for by the
cessation of those wars which peopled
them with military mutilation. The
establishment was calculated to provide
for five thousand men; and, at
that period, probably, it was always
full. At present, scarcely more than
half the number are under its roof; and,
as even the Algerine war is reduced
to skirmishes with the mountaineers
of the Atlas, that number must be
further diminishing from year to year.</p>

<p>The Cupola then shone with gilding.
This was the work of Napoleon, who
had a stately eye for the ornament of
his imperial city. The cupola of the
Invalides thus glittered above all the
roofs of Paris, and was seen glittering
to an immense distance. It might
be taken for the dedication of the
French capital to the genius of War.
This gilding is now worn off practically,
as well as metaphorically, and
the <em>prestige</em> is lost.</p>

<p>The celebrated Edmund Burke, all
whose ideas were grand, is said to
have proposed gilding the cupola of
St Paul's, which certainly would have
been a splendid sight, and would
have thrown a look of stateliness over
that city to which the ends of the
earth turn their eyes. But the civic
spirit was not equal to the idea, and
it has since gone on lavishing ten
times the money on the embellishment
of <em>lanes</em>.</p>

<p>The Chapel of the Invalides looked
gloomy, and even neglected; the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Magician was gone. Some service was
performing, as it is in the Romish
chapels at most hours of the day:
some poor people were kneeling in
different parts of the area; and some
strangers were, like myself, wandering
along the nave, looking at the
monuments to the fallen military
names of France. On the pillars in
the nave are inscriptions to the
memory of Jourdan, Lobau, and
Oudinot. There is a bronze tablet to
the memory of Marshal Mortier, who
was killed by Fieschi's infernal machine,
beside Louis Philippe; and to
Damremont, who fell in Algiers.</p>

<p>But the chapel is destined to exhibit
a more superb instance of national
recollection&mdash;the tomb of Napoleon,
which is to be finished in 1852. A
large circular crypt, dug in the centre
of the second chapel (which is to be
united with the first,) is the site of the
sarcophagus in which the remains of
Napoleon lie. Coryatides, columns,
and bas-reliefs, commemorative of his
battles, are to surround the sarcophagus.
The coryatides are to represent
War, Legislation, Art, and
Science; and in front is to be raised
an altar of black marble. The architect
is Visconti, and the best statuaries
in Paris are to contribute the decorations.
The expense will be enormous.
In the time of Louis Philippe
it had already amounted to nearly
four millions of francs. About three
millions more are now demanded for
the completion, including an equestrian
statue. On the whole, the
expense will be not much less than
seven millions of francs!</p>

<p>The original folly of the nation, and
of Napoleon, in plundering the Continent
of statues and pictures, inevitably
led to retribution, on the first
reverse of fortune. The plunder of
money, or of arms, or of anything
consumable, would have been exempt
from this mortification; but pictures
and statues are permanent things,
and always capable of being re-demanded.
Their plunder was an
extension of the law of spoil unknown
in European hostilities, or in history,
except perhaps in the old Roman
ravage of Greece. Napoleon, in
adopting the practice of heathenism
for his model, and the French nation&mdash;in
their assumed love of the arts
violating the sanctities of art, by
removing the noblest works from the
edifices for which they were created,
and from the lights and positions for
which the great artists of Italy designed
them&mdash;fully deserved the vexation
of seeing them thus carried back
to their original cities. The moral will,
it is to be presumed, be learned from
this signal example, that the works
of genius are <em>naturally</em> exempt from
the sweep of plunder; that even the
violences of war must not be extended
beyond the necessities of conquest;
and that an act of injustice is <em>sure</em> to
bring down its punishment in the
most painful form of retribution.</p>

<p><em>The Artesian Well.</em>&mdash;Near the Hôtel
des Invalides is the celebrated well
which has given the name to all the
modern experiments of boring to great
depths for water. The name of
Artesian is said to be taken from the
province of Artois, in which the practice
has been long known. The want
of water in Paris induced a M. Mulot
to commence the work in 1834.</p>

<p>The history of the process is instructive.
For six years there was no prospect
of success; yet M. Mulot gallantly
persevered. All was inexorable chalk;
the boring instrument had broken
several times, and the difficulty thus
occasioned may be imagined from its
requiring a length of thirteen hundred
feet! even in an early period of
the operation. However, early in
1841 the chalk gave signs of change,
and a greenish sand was drawn up.
On the 26th of February this was
followed by a slight effusion of water,
and before night the stream burst up
to the mouth of the excavation,
which was now eighteen hundred feet
in depth. Yet the water rapidly rose
to a height of one hundred and twelve
feet above the mouth of the well by a
pipe, which is now supported by scaffolding,
giving about six hundred gallons
of water a minute.</p>

<p>Even the memorable experiment
confutes, so far as it goes, the geological
notion of strata laid under each
other in their proportions of gravity.
The section of the boring shows chalk,
sand, gravel, shells, &amp;c., and this
order sometimes reversed, in the most
casual manner, down to a depth five
times the height of the cupola of the
Invalides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The heat of the water was 83° of
Fahrenheit. In the theories with
which the philosophers of the Continent
have to feed their imaginations
is that of a <em>central fire</em>, which is felt
through all the strata, and which
warms everything in proportion to its
nearness to the centre. Thus, it was
proposed to dig an Artesian well of
three thousand feet, for the supply of
hot water to the Jardin des Plantes
and the neighbouring hospitals. It
was supposed that, at this depth, the
heat would range to upwards of 100°
of Fahrenheit. But nothing has been
done. Even the Well of Grenelle
has rather disappointed the public
expectation; of late the supply has
been less constant, and the boring is
to be renewed to a depth of two thousand
feet.</p>

<p><em>The Napoleon Column.</em>&mdash;This is the
grand feature of the Place de Vendôme,
once the site of the Hôtel Vendôme,
built by the son of Henry IV.
and Gabrielle d'Estrées; afterwards
pulled down by Louis XIV., afterwards
abandoned to the citizens, and
afterwards surrounded, as it is at this
day, with the formal and heavy architecture
of Mansard. The "Place"
has, like everything in Paris, changed
its name from time to time. It was
once the "Place des Conquêtes;"
then it changed to "Louis le Grand;"
and then it returned to the name of its
original proprietor. An old figure of
the "Great King," in all the glories
of wig and feathers, stood in the
centre, till justice and the rabble of
the Revolution broke it down, in the
first "energies" of Republicanism.
But the German campaign of 1805
put all the nation in good humour,
and the Napoleon Column was raised
on the site of the dilapidated <em>monarch</em>.</p>

<p>The design of the column is not
original, for it is taken from the
Trajan Column at Rome; but it is
enlarged, and makes a very handsome
object. When I first saw it, its decorations
were in peril; for the Austrian
soldiery were loud for its demolition,
or at least for stripping off
its bronze bas-reliefs, they representing
their successive defeats in that
ignominious campaign which, in three
months from Boulogne, finished by
the capture of Vienna. The Austrian
troops, however, stoutly retrieved
their disasters, and, as the proof, were
then masters of Paris. It was possibly
this effective feeling that prevailed
at last to spare the column,
which the practice of the French
armies would have entitled them to
strip without mercy.</p>

<p>In the first instance, a statue of
Napoleon, as emperor, stood on the
summit of the pillar. This statue
had its revolutions too, for it was
melted down at the restoration of the
Bourbons, to make a part of the
equestrian statue of Henry IV. erected
on the Pont Neuf. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i> and
flagstaff then took its place. The
Revolution of 1830, which elevated
Louis Philippe to a temporary throne,
raised the statue of Napoleon to an
elevation perhaps as temporary.</p>

<p>It was the shortsighted policy of
the new monarch to mingle royal
power with "republican institutions."
He thus introduced the tricolor once
more, sent for Napoleon's remains to
St Helena by permission of England,
and erected his statue in the old
"chapeau et redingote gris," the
characteristics of his soldiership. The
statue was inaugurated on one of the
"three glorious days," in July 1833,
in all the pomp of royalty,&mdash;princes,
ministers, and troops. So much for
the consistency of a brother of the
Bourbon. The pageant passed away,
and the sacrifice to popularity was
made without obtaining the fruits.
Louis Philippe disappeared from the
scene before the fall of the curtain;
and, as if to render his catastrophe
more complete, he not merely left a
republic behind him, but he lived to
see the "prisoner of Ham" the president
of that republic.</p>

<p>How does it happen that an Englishman
in France cannot stir a single
step, hear a single word, or see a
single face, without the conviction
that he has landed among a people as
far from him in all their feelings,
habits, and nature, as if they were
engendered in the moon? The feelings
with which the Briton looks on the
statue of Buonaparte may be mixed
enough: he may acknowledge him for
a great soldier, as well as a great
knave&mdash;a great monarch, as well as a
little intriguer&mdash;a mighty ruler of
men, who would have made an adroit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
waiter at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> in the Palais
Royal. But he never would have
imagined him into a sentimentalist, a
shepherd, a Corydon, to be hung
round with pastoral garlands; an
opera hero, to delight in the sixpenny
tribute of bouquets from the
galleries.</p>

<p>Yet I found the image of this man
of terror and mystery&mdash;this ravager
of Europe&mdash;this stern, fierce, and
subtle master of havoc, decorated like
a milliner's shop, or the tombs of the
citizen shopkeepers in the cemeteries,
with garlands of all sizes!&mdash;the large
to express copious sorrow, the smaller
to express diminished anguish, and
the smallest, like a visiting card, for
simply leaving their compliments;
and all this in the face of the people
who once feared to look in his face,
and followed his car as if it bore the
Thunder!</p>

<p>To this spot came the people to offer
up their sixpenny homage&mdash;to this
spot came processions of all kinds, to
declare their republican love for the
darkest despot of European memory,
to sing a stave, to walk heroically
round the railing, hang up their garlands,
and then, having done their
duty in the presence of their own
grisettes, in the face of Paris, and to
the admiration of Europe, march
home, and ponder upon the glories of
the day!</p>

<p>As a work of imperial magnificence,
the column is worthy of its founder,
and of the only redeeming point of
his character&mdash;his zeal for the ornament
of Paris. It is a monument to
the military successes of the Empire;
a trophy one hundred and thirty-five
feet high, covered with the representations
of French victory over the
Austrians and Russians in the campaign
of 1805. The bas-reliefs are in
bronze, rising in a continued spiral
round the column. Yet this is an
unfortunate sacrifice to the imitation
of the Roman column. The spiral,
a few feet above the head of the
spectator, offers nothing to the eye
but a roll of rough bronze; the
figures are wholly and necessarily
undistinguishable. The only portion
of those castings which directly meets
the eye is unfortunately given up to
the mere uniforms, caps, and arms of
the combatants. This is the pedestal,
and it would make a showy decoration
for a tailor's window. It is a
clever work of the furnace, but a
miserable one of invention.</p>

<p>The bronze is said to have been the
captured cannon of the enemy. On
the massive bronze door is the inscription
in Latin:&mdash;"Napoleon, Emperor,
Augustus, dedicated to the glory of
the Grand Army this memorial of the
German War, finished in three months,
in the year 1805, under his command."</p>

<p>On the summit stands the statue of
Napoleon, to which, and its changes, I
have adverted already. But the question
has arisen, whether there is not
an error in taste in placing the statue
of an individual at a height which
precludes the view of his <em>features</em>.
This has been made an objection to
the handsome Nelson Pillar in Trafalgar
Square. But the obvious answer
in both instances is, that the
object is not merely the sight of the
features, but the perfection of the
memorial; that the pillar is the true
<em>monument</em>, and the statue only an
accessory, though the most <em>suitable</em>
accessory. But even then the statue
is not altogether inexpressive. We
can see the figure and the costume of
Napoleon nearly as well as they could
be seen from the balcony of the Tuilleries,
where all Paris assembled in
the Carousel to worship him on Sundays,
at the parade of "La Garde."
In the spirited statue of Nelson we
can recognise the figure as well as if
we were gazing at him within a hundred
yards in any other direction. It
is true that pillars are not painters'
easels, nor is Trafalgar Square a
sculptor's yard; but the real question
turns on the effect of the whole. If
the pillar makes the monument, we
will not quarrel with the sculptor for
its not making a <em>miniature</em>. It answers
its purpose&mdash;it is a noble one;
it gives a national record of great
events, and it realises, invigorates,
and consecrates them by the images
of the men by whom they were
achieved.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile.</i>&mdash;It is
no small adventure, in a burning day
of a French summer, to walk the
length of the Champs Elysées, even
to see the arch of the Star, (Napoleon's
<em>Star</em>,) and climb to its summit. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
this labour I accomplished with the
fervour and the fatigue of a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Why should the name of Republic
be ever heard in the mouth of a
Frenchman? All the objects of his
glory in the Capital of which he
<em>glories</em>, everything that he can show
to the stranger&mdash;everything that he
recounts, standing on tip-toe, and
looking down on the whole world
besides&mdash;is the work of monarchy!
The grand Republic left nothing behind
but the guillotine. The Bourbons
and Buonapartes were the creators
of all to which he points, with an
exaltation that throws earth into the
shade from the Alps to the Andes.
The Louvre, the Madeleine, the Tuilleries,
the Hôtel de Ville, (now magnified
and renovated into the most
stately of town-houses,) the Hôtel
des Invalides, Nôtre Dame, &amp;c. &amp;c.
are all the work of Kings. If Napoleon
had lived half a century longer,
he would have made Paris a second
Babylon. If the very clever President,
who has hitherto managed
France so dexterously, and whose
name so curiously combines the monarchy
and the despotism,&mdash;if Louis
<em>Napoleon</em> (a name which an old
Roman would have pronounced an
omen) should manage it into a Monarchy,
we shall probably see Paris
crowded with superb public edifices.</p>

<p>The kings of France were peculiarly
magnificent in the decoration of the
entrances to their city. As no power
on earth can prevent the French from
crowding into hovels, from living ten
families in one house, and from appending
to their cities the most
miserable, ragged, and forlorn-looking
suburbs on the globe, the
monarchs wisely let the national
habits alone; and resolved, if the
suburbs must be abandoned to the
popular fondness for the wigwam, to
impress strangers with the stateliness
of their gates. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de St Denis</i>,
once conducting from the most dismal
of suburbs, is one of the finest
portals in Paris, or in any European
city; it is worthy of the Boulevard,
and that is panegyric at once. Every
one knows <em>that it was</em> erected in
honour of the short-lived inroad of
Louis XIV. into Holland in 1672,
and the taking of whole muster-rolls
of forts and villages, left at his mercy,
ungarrisoned and unprovisioned, by
the Republican parsimony of the
Dutch, till a princely defender arose,
and the young Stadtholder sent back
the coxcomb monarch faster than he
came. But the Arc is a noble work,
and its architecture might well set a
redeeming example to the London
<em>improvers</em>. Why not erect an arch in
Southwark? Why not at all the
great avenues to the capital? Why
not, instead of leaving this task to
the caprices, or even to the bad taste
of the railway companies, make it a
branch of the operations of the
Woods and Forests, and ennoble
all the entrances of the mightiest
capital of earthly empire?</p>

<p>The Arch of St Denis is now shining
in all the novelty of reparation,
for it was restored so lately as last
year. In this quarter, which has
been always of a stormy temperature,
the insurrection of 1848 raged with
especial fury; and if the spirits of the
great ever hover about their monuments,
Louis XIV. may have seen
from its summit a more desperate
conflict than ever figured on its bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>On the Arch of the Porte St Martin
is a minor monument to minor triumphs,
but a handsome one. Louis
XIV. is still the hero. The "Grand
Monarque" is exhibited as Hercules
with his club; but as even a monarch
in those days was nothing without
his wig, Hercules exhibits a huge
mass of curls of the most courtly
dimensions&mdash;he might pass for the
presiding deity of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perruquiers</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe du Carousel</i>,
erected in honour of the German
campaign in 1805, is a costly performance,
yet poor-looking, from its
position in the centre of lofty buildings.
What effect can an isolated arch, of
but five-and-forty feet high, have
in the immediate vicinity of masses
of building, perhaps a hundred feet
high? Its aspect is consequently
meagre; and its being placed in the
centre of a court makes it look useless,
and, of course, ridiculous. On the
summit is a figure of War, or Victory,
in a chariot, with four bronze horses&mdash;the
horses modelled from the four
Constantinopolitan horses brought
by the French from Venice, as part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the plunder of that luckless city, but
sent back to Venice by the Allies in
1815. The design of the arch was from
that of Severus, in Rome: this secured,
at least, elegance in its construction;
but the position is fatal to dignity.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de l'Etoile</i> is the finest
work of the kind in Paris. It has
the advantage of being built on an
elevation, from which it overlooks the
whole city, with no building of any
magnitude in its vicinity; and is seen
from a considerable distance on all the
roads leading to the capital. Its cost
was excessive for a work of mere ornament,
and is said to have amounted
to nearly half a million sterling!</p>

<p>As I stood glancing over the groups
on the friezes and faces of this great
monument, which exhibit war in
every form of conflict, havoc, and
victory, the homely thought of "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui
bono</i>?" struck me irresistibly. Who
was the better for all this havoc?&mdash;Napoleon,
whom it sent to a dungeon!
or the miserable thousands and tens
of thousands whom it crushed in the
field?&mdash;or the perhaps more unfortunate
hundreds of thousands whom
it sent to the hospital, to die the
slow death of exhaustion and pain,
or to live the protracted life of mutilation?
I have no affectation of
sentiment at the sight of the soldier's
grave; he has but taken his share
of the common lot, with perhaps the
advantage, which so few men possess,
of having "done the state some
service." But, to see this vast monument
covered with the emblems of
hostilities, continued through almost
a quarter of a century, (for the groups
commence with 1792;) to think of the
devastation of the fairest countries of
Europe, of which these hostilities
were the cause; and to know the utter
fruitlessness and failure of the result,
the short-lived nature of the triumph,
and the frightful depth of the defeat&mdash;-Napoleon
in ignominious bondage and
hopeless banishment&mdash;Napoleon, after
having lorded it over Europe, sent to
linger out life on a rock in the centre
of the ocean&mdash;the leader of military
millions kept under the eye of a British
sentinel, and no more suffered to
stray beyond his bounds than a caged
tiger&mdash;I felt as if the object before me
was less a trophy than a tomb, less a
monument of glory than of retribution,
less the record of national triumph
than of national frenzy.</p>

<p>I had full liberty for reflection, for
there was scarcely a human being to
interrupt me. The bustle of the capital
did not reach so far, the promenaders
in the Champs Elysées did
not venture here; the showy equipages
of the Parisian "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveaux
riches</i>" remained where the crowd
was to be seen; and except a few
peasants going on their avocations,
and a bench full of soldiers, sleeping
or smoking away the weariness of the
hour, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</i>, which
had cost so much treasure, and was
the record of so much blood, seemed
to be totally forgotten. I question, if
there had been a decree of the Legislature
to sell the stones, whether it
would have occasioned more than a
paragraph in the <cite>Journal des Debats</cite>.</p>

<p>The ascent to the summit is by a
long succession of dark and winding
steps, for which a lamp is lighted by
the porter; but the view from the
parapet repays the trouble of the
ascent. The whole basin in which
Paris lies is spread out before the
eye. The city is seen in the centre
of a valley, surrounded on every side
by a circle of low hills, sheeted with
dark masses of wood. It was probably
once the bed of a lake, in which
the site of the city was an island.
All the suburb villages came within
the view, with the fortifications, which
to a more scientific eye might appear
formidable, but which to mine appeared
mere dots in the vast landscape.</p>

<p>This parapet is unhappily sometimes
used for other purposes than the indulgence
of the spectacle. A short time
since, a determined suicide sprang from
it, after making a speech to the soldiery
below, assigning his reason for this
tremendous act&mdash;if reason has anything
to do in such a desperate determination
to defy common sense. He
acted with the quietest appearance of
deliberation: let himself down on the
coping of the battlement, from this
made his speech, as if he had been in the
tribune; and, having finished it, flung
himself down a height of ninety feet,
and was in an instant a crushed and
lifeless heap on the pavement below.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, even in these
crimes, there exists the distinction
which seems to divide France from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
England in every better thing. In
England, a wretch undone by poverty,
broken down by incurable pain, afflicted
by the stings of a conscience
which she neither knows how to heal
nor cares how to cure, woman, helpless,
wretched, and desolate, takes her
walk under cover of night by the
nearest river, and, without a witness,
plunges in. But, in France, the last
dreadful scene is imperfect without its
publicity; the suicide must exhibit
before the people. There must be
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valete et plaudite</i>. The curtain
must fall with dramatic effect, and
the actor must make his exit with the
cries of the audience, in admiration or
terror, ringing in the ear.</p>

<p>In other cases, however varied, the
passion for publicity is still the same.
No man can bear to perish in silence.
If the atheist resolves on self-destruction,
he writes a treatise for his publisher,
or a letter to the journals. If he
is a man of science, he takes his laudanum
after supper, and, pen in hand,
notes the gradual effects of the poison
for the benefit of science; or he prepares
a fire of charcoal, quietly inhales
the vapour, and from his sofa continues
to scribble the symptoms of
dissolution, until the pen grows unsteady,
the brain wanders, and half-a-dozen
blots close the scene; the
writing, however, being dedicated to
posterity, and circulated next day in
every journal of Paris, till it finally
permeates through the provinces, and
from thence through the European
world.</p>

<p>The number of suicides in Paris
annually, of late years, has been about
three hundred,&mdash;out of a population
of a million, notwithstanding the suppression
of the gaming-houses, which
unquestionably had a large share in
the temptation to this horrible and
unatonable crime.</p>

<p>The sculptures on the Arc are in
the best style. They form a history
of the Consulate and of the Empire.
Napoleon, of course, is a prominent
figure; but in the fine bas-relief
which is peculiarly devoted to himself,
in which he stands of colossal
size, with Fame flying over his head,
History writing the record of his exploits,
and Victory crowning him,
the artist has left his work liable to
the sly sarcasm of a spectator of a
similar design for the statue of Louis
XIV. Victory was there holding
the laurel at a slight distance from
his head. An Englishman asked
"whether she was putting it on <em>or
taking it off</em>?" But another of the
sculptures is still more unfortunate,
for it has the unintentional effect of
commemorating the Allied conquest
of France in 1814. A young Frenchman
is seen defending his family; and
a soldier behind him is seen falling
from his horse, and the Genius of
the <em>future</em> flutters over them all. We
know what that future was.</p>

<p>The building of this noble memorial
occupied, at intervals, no less than
thirty years, beginning in 1806, when
Napoleon issued a decree for its erection.
The invasion in 1814 put a stop
to everything in France, and the building
was suspended. The fruitless and
foolish campaign of the Duc d'Angoulême,
in Spain, was regarded by
the Bourbons as a title to national
glories, and the building was resumed
as a trophy to the renown of the Duc.
It was again interrupted by the expulsion
of the Bourbons in 1830; but
was resumed under Louis Philippe,
and finished in 1836. It is altogether
a very stately and very handsome
tribute to the French armies.</p>

<p>But, without affecting unnecessary
severity of remark, may not the
wisdom of such a tribute be justly
doubted? The Romans, though the
principle of their power was conquest,
and though their security was almost
incompatible with peace, yet are said
to have never repaired a triumphal
arch. It is true that they built those
arches (in the latter period of the
Empire) so solidly as to want no
repairs. But we have no triumphal
monuments of the Republic surviving.
Why should it be the constant policy
of Continental governments to pamper
their people with the food of that most
dangerous and diseased of all vanities,
the passion for war? And this is not
said in the declamatory spirit of the
"Peace Congress," which seems to
be nothing more than a pretext for
a Continental ramble, an expedient
for a little vulgar notoriety among
foreigners, and an opportunity of getting
rid of the greatest quantity of
common-place in the shortest time.
But, why should not France learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
common sense from the experience of
England? It is calculated that, of the
last five hundred years of French history,
two hundred and fifty have been
spent in hostilities. In consequence,
France has been invaded, trampled,
and impoverished by war; while England,
during the last three hundred
years, has never seen the foot of a
foreign invader.</p>

<p>Let the people of France abolish
the <em>Conscription</em>, and they will have
made one advance to liberty. Till
cabinets are deprived of that material
of <em>aggressive</em> war, they will
leave war at the caprice of a weak
monarch, an ambitious minister, or a
vainglorious people. It is remarkable
that, among all the attempts at reforming
the constitution of France,
her reformers have never touched upon
the ulcer of the land, the Conscription,
the legacy of a frantic Republic,
taking the children of the country
from their industry, to plunge them
into the vices of idleness or the havoc
of war, and at all times to furnish
the means, as well as afford the
temptation, to aggressive war. There
is not at this hour a soldier of England
who has been <em>forced</em> into the
service! Let the French, let all the
Continental nations, abolish the Conscription,
thus depriving their governments
of the means of making war
upon each other; and what an infinite
security would not this illustrious
abolition give to the whole of Europe!&mdash;what
an infinite saving in the taxes
which are now wrung from nations by
the fear of each other!&mdash;and what an
infinite triumph to the spirit of peace,
industry, and mutual good-will!</p>

<p><em>The Theatres.</em>&mdash;In the evening I
wandered along the Boulevard, the
great centre of the theatres, and was
surprised at the crowds which, in a
hot summer night, could venture to
be stewed alive, amid the smell of
lamps, the effluvia of orange-peel, the
glare of lights, and the breathing of
hundreds or thousands of human
beings. I preferred the fresh air, the
lively movement of the Boulevard,
the glitter of the Cafés, and the
glow, then tempered, of the declining
sun&mdash;one of the prettiest moving
panoramas of Paris.</p>

<p>The French Government take a
great interest in the popularity of the
theatres, and exert that species of
superintendence which is implied in
a considerable supply of the theatrical
expenditure. The French Opera
receives annually from the National
Treasury no less than 750,000 francs,
besides 130,000 for retiring pensions.
To the Théâtre Français, the allowance
from the Treasury is 240,000
francs a-year. To the Italian Opera
the sum granted was formerly 70,000,
but is now 50,000. Allowances are
made to the Opera Comique, a most
amusing theatre, to the Odeon, and
perhaps to some others&mdash;the whole
demanding of the budget a sum of
more than a million of francs.</p>

<p>It is curious that the drama in
France began with the clergy. In
the time of Charles VI., a company,
named "Confrères de la Passion,"
performed plays founded on the events
of Scripture, though grossly disfigured
by the traditions of Monachism. The
originals were probably the "<em>Mysteries</em>,"
or plays in the Convents, a
species of absurd and fantastic representation
common in all Popish countries.
At length the life of Manners
was added to the life of Superstition,
and singers and grimacers
were added to the "Confrères."</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century an Italian
company appeared in Paris, and
brought with them their opera, the
invention of the Florentines fifty
years before. The cessation of the
civil wars allowed France for a while
to cultivate the arts of peace; and
Richelieu, a man who, if it could be
said of any statesman that he formed
the mind of the nation, impressed his
image and superscription upon his
country, gave the highest encouragement
to the drama by making it the
fashion. He even wrote, or assisted
in writing, popular dramas. Corneille
now began to flourish, and French
Tragedy was established.</p>

<p>Mazarin, when minister, and, like
Richelieu, master of the nation, invited
or admitted the Italian Opera
once more into France; and Molière,
at the head of a new company, obtained
leave to perform before Louis
XIV., who thenceforth patronised the
great comic writer, and gave his company
a theatre. The Tragedy, Comedy,
and Opera of France now led
the way in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>In France, the Great Revolution,
while it multiplied the theatres with
the natural extravagance of the time,
yet, by a consequence equally inevitable,
degraded the taste of the nation.
For a long period the legitimate
drama was almost extinguished:
it was unexciting to a people trained
day by day to revolutionary convulsion;
the pageants on the stage were
tame to the processions in the streets;
and the struggles of kings and nobles
were ridiculous to the men who had
been employed in destroying a
dynasty.</p>

<p>Napoleon at once perceived the
evil, and adopted the only remedy.
He found no less than <em>thirty</em> theatres
in Paris. He was not a man to
pause where he saw his way clearly
before him; he closed twenty-two of
those theatres, leaving but eight, and
those chiefly of the old establishments,
making a species of compensation to
the closed houses.</p>

<p>On the return of the Bourbons the
civil list, as in the old times, assisted
in the support of the theatres. On
the accession of Louis Philippe, the
popular triumph infused its extravagance
even into the system of the
drama. The number of the theatres
increased, and a succession of writers
of the "New School" filled the
theatres with abomination. Gallantry
became the <em>spirit</em> of the drama&mdash;everything
before the scene was intrigue;
married life was the perpetual burlesque.
Wives were the habitual
heroines of the intrigue, and husbands
the habitual dupes! To keep faith
with a husband was a standing jest
on the stage, to keep it with a seducer
was the height of human character.
The former was always described as
brutal, gross, dull, and born to be
duped; the latter was captivating,
generous, and irresistible by any
matron alive. In fact, wives and
widows were made for nothing else
but to give way to the fascinations of
this class of professors of the arts of
"good society." The captivator was
substantially described as a scoundrel,
a gambler, and a vagabond of the
basest kind, but withal so honourable,
so tender, and so susceptible, that his
atrocities disappeared, or rather were
transmuted into virtues, by the brilliancy
of his qualifications for seducing
the wife of his friend. Perjury, profligacy,
and the betrayal of confidence
in the most essential tie of human
nature, were supreme in popularity in
the Novel and on the Stage.</p>

<p>The direct consequence is, that
the crime of adultery is lightly considered
in France; even the pure speak
of it without the abhorrence which,
for every reason, it deserves. Its
notoriety is rather thought of as an
anecdote of the day, or the gossiping
of the soirée; and the most acknowledged
licentiousness does not exclude
a man of a certain rank from general
reception in good society.</p>

<p>One thing may be observed on the
most casual intercourse with Frenchmen&mdash;that
the vices which, in our
country, create disgust and offence in
grave society, and laughter and levity
in the more careless, seldom produce
either the one or the other in France.
The topic is alluded to with neither a
frown nor a smile; it is treated, in
general, as a matter of course, either
too natural to deserve censure, or too
common to excite ridicule. It is seldom
peculiarly alluded to, for the general
conversation of "Good Society" is
decorous; but to denounce it would be
unmannered. The result is an extent
of illegitimacy enough to corrupt the
whole rising population. By the registers
of 1848, of 30,000 children
born in Paris in that year, there were
10,000 illegitimate, of which but
1700 were acknowledged by their
parents!</p>

<p>The theatrical profession forms an
important element in the population.
The actors and actresses amount to
about 5000. In England they are
probably not as many hundreds.
And though the French population is
35,000,000, while Great Britain has
little more than twenty, yet the disproportion
is enormous, and forms a
characteristic difference of the two
countries. The persons occupied in
the "working" of the theatrical system
amount perhaps to 10,000, and
the families dependent on the whole
form a very large and very influential
class among the general orders of
society.</p>

<p>But if the Treasury assists in their
general support, it compels them to
pay eight per cent of their receipts
as a contribution to the hospitals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
This sum averages annually a million
of francs, or £40,000 sterling.</p>

<p>In England we might learn something
from the theatrical regulations
of France. The trampling of our
crowds at the doors of theatres, the
occasional losses of life and limb, and
the general inconvenience and confusion
of the entrance on crowded nights,
might be avoided by the were adoption
of French <em>order</em>.</p>

<p>But why should not higher objects
be held in view? The drama is a
public <em>necessity</em>; the people will have
it, whether good or bad. Why should
not Government offer prizes to the
best drama, tragic or comic? Why
should the most distinguished work
of poetic genius find no encouragement
from the Government of a nation
boasting of its love of letters? Why
shall that encouragement be left to
the caprice of managers, to the
finances of struggling establishments,
or to the tastes of theatres, forced by
their poverty to pander to the rabble.
Why should not the mischievous performances
of those theatres be put
down, and dramas, founded on the
higher principles of our nature, be the
instruments of putting them down?
Why should not heroism, honour, and
patriotism, be taught on the national
stage, as well as the triumphs of the
highroad, laxity among the higher
ranks, and vice among all? The
drama has been charged with corruption.
Is that corruption essential? It
has been charged with being a <em>nucleus</em>
of the loose principles, as its places of
representation have been haunted by
the loose characters, of society. But
what are these but excrescences, generated
by the carelessness of society,
by the indolence of magistracy, and
by the general misconception of the
real purposes and possible power of
the stage? That power is magnificent.
It takes human nature in her
most <em>impressible</em> form, in the time of
the glowing heart and the ready tear,
of the senses animated by scenery,
melted by music, and spelled by the
living realities of representation.
Why should not impressions be
made in that hour which the man
would carry with him through all the
contingencies of life, and which would
throw a light on every period of his
being?</p>

<p>The conditions of recompense to
authors in France make <em>some</em> advance
to justice. The author of a Drama is
entitled to a profit on its performance
in every theatre of France during his
life, with a continuance for ten years
after to his heirs. For a piece of
three or five acts, the remuneration is
<em>one twelfth part</em> of the gross receipts,
and for a piece in one act, one twenty-fourth.
A similar compensation has
been adopted in the English theatre,
but seems to have become completely
nugatory, from the managers' purchasing
the author's rights&mdash;the transaction
here being made a private one,
and the remuneration being at the
mercy of the manager. But in France
it is a public matter, an affair of law,
and looked to by an agent in Paris,
who registers the performance of the
piece at all the theatres in the city,
and in the provinces.</p>

<p>Still, this is injustice. Why should
the labour of the intellect be less
permanent than the labour of the
hands? Why should not the author
be entitled to make his full demand
instead of this pittance? If his play
is worth acting, why is it not worth
paying for?&mdash;and why should he be
prohibited from having the fruit of his
brain as an inheritance to his family,
as well as the fruit of any other toll?</p>

<p>If, instead of being a man of genius,
delighting and elevating the mind of
a nation, he were a blacksmith, he
might leave his tools and his trade to
his children without any limit; or if,
with the produce of his play, he purchased
a cow, or a cabin, no man
could lay a claim upon either. But
he must be taxed for being a man of
talent; and men of no talent must be
entitled, by an absurd law and a palpable
injustice, to tear the fruit of his
intellectual supremacy from his children
after ten short years of possession.</p>

<p>No man leaves Paris without regret,
and without a wish for the
liberty and peace of its people.</p>

<h2>MR RUSKIN'S WORKS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Modern Painters</em>, vol. i. Second edition.&mdash;&mdash;<cite>Modern Painters</cite>, vol. ii.&mdash;&mdash;<cite>The
Seven Lamps of Architecture.</cite>&mdash;&mdash;<cite>The Stones of Venice.</cite>&mdash;&mdash;<cite>Notes on the Construction
of Sheepfolds.</cite> By <span class="smcap">John Ruskin</span>, M.A.</p></blockquote>


<p>On the publication of the first
volume of Mr Ruskin's work on
Modern Painters, a notice appeared
of it in this Magazine. Since that
time a second volume has been published
of the same work, with two
other works on architecture. It is
the second volume of his <cite>Modern
Painters</cite> which will at present chiefly
engage our attention. His architectural
works can only receive a slight
and casual notice; on some future
occasion they may tempt us into a
fuller examination.</p>

<p>Although the second volume of the
<cite>Modern Painters</cite> will be the immediate
subject of our review, we must
permit ourselves to glance back upon
the first, in order to connect together
the topics treated by the two, and to
prevent our paper from wearing quite
the aspect of a metaphysical essay;
for it is the nature of the sentiment
of the beautiful, and its sources in
the human mind, which is the main
subject of this second volume. In
the first, he had entered at once into
the arena of criticism, elevating the
modern artists, and one amongst them
in particular, at the expense of the old
masters, who, with some few exceptions,
find themselves very rudely
handled.</p>

<p>As we have already intimated, we
do not hold Mr Ruskin to be a safe
guide in matters of art, and the present
volume demonstrates that he is
no safe guide in matters of philosophy.
He is a man of undoubted power and
vigour of mind; he feels strongly,
and he thinks independently: but he
is hasty and impetuous; can very
rarely, on any subject, deliver a calm
and temperate judgment; and, when
he enters on the discussion of general
principles, shows an utter inability to
seize on, or to appreciate, the wide
generalisations of philosophy. He is
not, therefore, one of those men who
can ever become an authority to be
appealed to by the less instructed in
any of the fine arts, or on any topic
whatever; and this we say with the
utmost confidence, because, although
we may be unable in many cases to
dispute his judgment&mdash;as where he
speaks of paintings we have not seen,
or technicalities of art we do not
affect to understand&mdash;yet he so frequently
stands forth on the broad
arena where general and familiar
principles are discussed, that it is
utterly impossible <em>to be mistaken in
the man</em>. On all these occasions he
displays a very marked and rather
peculiar combination of power and
weakness&mdash;of power, the result of
natural strength of mind; of weakness,
the inevitable consequence of a
passionate haste, and an overweening
confidence. When we hear a person
of this intellectual character throwing
all but unmitigated abuse upon works
which men have long consented to
admire, and lavishing upon some other
works encomiums which no conceivable
perfection of human art could
justify, it is utterly impossible to
attach any weight to his opinion, on
the ground that he has made an especial
study of any one branch of art.
Such a man we cannot trust out of
our sight a moment; we cannot give
him one inch of ground more than his
reasoning covers, or our own experience
would grant to him.</p>

<p>We shall not here revive the controversy
on the comparative merits of
the ancient and modern landscape-painters,
nor on the later productions
of Mr Turner, whether they are the
eccentricities of genius or its fullest
development; we have said enough
on these subjects before. It is Mr
Ruskin's book, and not the pictures of
Claude or Turner, that we have to
criticise; it is his style, and his manner
of thinking, that we have to pass
judgment on.</p>

<p>In all Mr Ruskin's works, and in
almost every page of them, whether
on painting, or architecture, or philosophy,
or ecclesiastical controversy,
two characteristics invariably prevail:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
an extreme dogmatism, and a passion
for singularity. Every man who
thinks earnestly would convert all the
world to his own opinions; but while
Mr Ruskin would convert all the
world to his own tastes as well as
opinions, he manifests the greatest
repugnance to think for a moment
like any one else. He has a mortal
aversion to mingle with a crowd. It
is quite enough for an opinion to be
commonplace to insure it his contempt:
if it has passed out of fashion,
he may revive it; but to think with
the existing multitude would be impossible.
Yet that multitude are to
think with him. He is as bent on
unity in matters of taste as others
are on unity in matters of religion;
and he sets the example by diverging,
wherever he can, from the tastes of
others.</p>

<p>Between these two characteristics
there is no real contradiction; or
rather the contradiction is quite familiar.
The man who most affects
singularity is generally the most
dogmatic: he is the very man who
expresses most surprise that others
should differ from him. No one is so
impatient of contradiction as he who
is perpetually contradicting others;
and on the gravest matters of religion
those are often found to be most
zealous for unity of belief who have
some pet heresy of their own, for
which they are battling all their lives.
The same overweening confidence lies,
in fact, at the basis of both these
characteristics. In Mr Ruskin they
are both seen in great force. No
matter what the subject he discusses,&mdash;taste
or ecclesiastical government&mdash;we
always find the same combination
of singularity, with a dogmatism approaching
to intolerance. Thus, the
Ionic pillar is universally admired.
Mr Ruskin finds that the fluted shaft
gives an appearance of weakness.
No one ever felt this, so long as the
fluted column is manifestly of sufficient
diameter to sustain the weight
imposed on it. But this objection of
apparent insecurity has been very
commonly made to the spiral or
twisted column. Here, therefore, Mr
Ruskin abruptly dismisses the objection.
He was at liberty to defend
the spiral column: we should say
here, also, that if the weight imposed
was evidently not too great for even a
spiral column to support, <em>this</em> objection
has no place; but why cast the
same objection, (which perhaps in all
cases was a mere after-thought)
against the Ionic shaft, when it had
never been felt at all? It has been a
general remark, that, amongst other
results of the railway, it has given a
new field to the architect, as well as
to the engineer. Therefore Mr
Ruskin resolves that our railroad
stations ought to have no architecture
at all. Of course, if he limited his
objections to inappropriate ornament,
he would be agreeing with all the
world: he decides there should be no
architecture whatever; merely buildings
more or less spacious, to protect
men and goods from the weather.
He has never been so unfortunate, we
suppose, as to come an hour too soon,
or the unlucky five minutes too late,
to a railway station, or he would
have been glad enough to find himself
in something better than the large
shed he proposes. On the grave subject
of ecclesiastical government he
has stepped forward into controversy;
and here he shows both his usual
propensities in <em>high relief</em>. He has
some quite peculiar projects of his
own; the appointment of some hundreds
of bishops&mdash;we know not what&mdash;and
a Church discipline to be carried
out by trial by jury. Desirable or
not, they are manifestly as impracticable
as the revival of chivalry.
But let that pass. Let every man
think and propose his best. But his
dogmatism amounts to a disease,
when, turning from his own novelties,
he can speak in the flippant intolerant
manner that he does of the national
and now time-honoured Church of
Scotland.</p>

<p>It will be worth while to make, in
passing, a single quotation from this
pamphlet, <cite>Notes on the Construction
of Sheepfolds</cite>. He tells us, in one
place, that in the New Testament the
ministers of the Church "are called,
and call themselves, with absolute
indifference, Deacons, Bishops, Elders,
Evangelists, according to what they
are doing at the time of speaking."
With such a writer one might, at all
events, have hoped to live in peace.
But no. He discovers, nevertheless,
that Episcopacy is the Scriptural form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of Church government; and, having
satisfied his own mind of this, no
opposition or diversity of opinion is
for a moment to be tolerated.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But how," he says, "unite the two
great sects of paralysed Protestants?
By keeping simply to Scripture. <em>The
members of the Scottish Church have not a
shadow of excuse for refusing Episcopacy</em>:
it has indeed been abused among them,
grievously abused; but it is in the Bible,
and that is all they have a right to ask.</p>

<p>"<em>They have also no shadow of excuse
for refusing to employ a written form of
prayer.</em> It may not be to their taste&mdash;it
may not be the way in which they like
to pray; but it is no question, at present,
of likes or dislikes, but of duties; and
the acceptance of such a form on their
part would go half way to reconcile them
with their brethren. Let them allege
such objections as they can reasonably
advance against the English form, and
let these be carefully and humbly weighed
by the pastors of both Churches: some of
them ought to be at once forestalled.
For the English Church, on the other
hand, <em>must</em>," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Into Mr Ruskin's own religious
tenets, further than he has chosen to
reveal them in his works, we have no
wish to pry. But he must cease
to be Mr Ruskin if they do not exhibit
some salient peculiarity, coupled
with a confidence, unusual even
amongst zealots, that his peculiar
views will speedily triumph. If he
can be presumed to belong to any
sect, it must be the last and smallest
one amongst us&mdash;some sect as exclusive
as German mysticism, with pretensions
as great as those of the
Church of Rome.</p>

<p>One word on the style of Mr
Ruskin: it will save the trouble of
alluding to it on particular occasions.
It is very unequal. In both his
architectural works he writes generally
with great ease, spirit, and
clearness. There is a racy vigour in
the page. But when he would be
very eloquent, as he is disposed to be
in the <cite>Modern Painters</cite>, he becomes
very verbose, tedious, obscure, extravagant.
There is no discipline in his
style, no moderation, no repose.
Those qualities which he has known
how to praise in art he has not aimed
at in his own writing. A rank luxuriance
of a semi-poetical diction lies
about, perfectly unrestrained; metaphorical
language comes before us in
every species of disorder; and hyperbolical
expressions are used till they
become commonplace. Verbal criticism,
he would probably look upon
a very puerile business: he need fear
nothing of the kind from us; we
should as soon think of criticising or
pruning a jungle. To add to the confusion,
he appears at times to have
proposed to himself the imitation of
some of our older writers: pages are
written in the rhythm of Jeremy
Taylor; sometimes it is the venerable
Hooker who seems to be his type;
and he has even succeeded in combining
whatever is most tedious and
prolix in both these great writers. If
the reader wishes a specimen of this
sort of <em>modern antique</em>, he may turn
to the fifteenth chapter of the second
volume of the <cite>Modern Painters</cite>.</p>

<p>Coupled with this matter of style,
and almost inseparable from it, is the
violence of his manner on subjects
which cannot possibly justify so vehement
a zeal. We like a generous
enthusiasm on any art&mdash;we delight in
it; but who can travel in sympathy
with a writer who exhausts on so
much paint and canvass every term
of rapture that the Alps themselves
could have called forth? One need
not be a utilitarian philosopher&mdash;or
what Mr Ruskin describes as such&mdash;to
smile at the lofty position on which
he puts the landscape-painter, and
the egregious and impossible demands
he makes upon the art itself. And the
condemnation and opprobrium with
which he overwhelms the luckless
artist who has offended him is quite
as violent. The bough of a tree, "in
the left hand upper corner" of a landscape
of Poussin's, calls forth this
terrible denunciation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This latter is a representation of an
ornamental group of elephants' tusks,
with feathers tied to the ends of them.
Not the wildest imagination could ever
conjure up in it the remotest resemblance
to the bough of a tree. It might be the
claws of a witch&mdash;the talons of an eagle&mdash;the
horns of a fiend; but it is a full
assemblage of every conceivable falsehood
which can be told respecting foliage&mdash;a
piece of work so barbarous in every way
<em>that one glance at it ought to prove the
complete charlatanism and trickery of the
whole system of the old landscape-painters</em>.... I
will say here at once, that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
drawing as this is as ugly as it is childish,
and as painful as it is false; and that the
man who could tolerate, much more, who
could deliberately set down such a thing
on his canvass, <em>had neither eye nor feeling
for one single attribute or excellence of
God's works</em>. He might have drawn <em>the
other stem</em> in excusable ignorance, or under
some false impression of being able to
improve upon nature, but this is conclusive
and unpardonable."&mdash;(P. 382.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The great redeeming quality of Mr
Ruskin&mdash;and we wish to give it conspicuous
and honourable mention&mdash;is
his love of nature. Here lies the
charm of his works; to this may be
traced whatever virtue is in them, or
whatever utility they may possess.
They will send the painter more than
ever to the study of nature, and perhaps
they will have a still more beneficial
effect on the art, by sending the
critic of painting to the same school.
It would be almost an insult to the
landscape-painter to suppose that he
needed this lesson; the very love of
his art must lead him perpetually, one
would think, to his great and delightful
study amongst the fields, under the
open skies, before the rivers and the
hills. But the critic of the picture-gallery
is often one who goes from
picture to picture, and very little from
nature to the painting. Consequently,
where an artist succeeds in imitating
some effect in nature which had not
been before represented on the canvass,
such a critic is more likely to be
displeased than gratified; and the
artist, having to paint for a conventional
taste, is in danger of sacrificing
to it his own higher aspirations. Now
it is most true that no man should
pretend to be a critic upon pictures
unless he understands the art itself of
painting; he ought, we suspect, to
have handled the pencil or the brush
himself; at all events, he ought in
some way to have been initiated into
the mysteries of the pallet and the
easel. Otherwise, not knowing the
difficulties to be overcome, nor the
means at hand for encountering them,
he cannot possibly estimate the degree
of merit due to the artist for the production
of this or that effect. He may
be loud in applause where nothing has
been displayed but the old traditions
of the art. But still this is only one-half
the knowledge he ought to possess.
He ought to have studied
nature, and to have loved the study,
or he can never estimate, and never
feel, that <em>truth</em> of effect which is the
great aim of the artist. Mr Ruskin's
works will help to shame out of the
field all such half-informed and conventional
criticism, the mere connoisseurship
of the picture gallery. On
the other hand, they will train men
who have always been delighted spectators
of nature to be also attentive
observers. Our critics will learn how
to admire, and mere admirers will learn
how to criticise. Thus a public will
be educated; and here, if anywhere,
we may confidently assert that the
art will prosper in proportion as there
is an intelligent public to reward it.</p>

<p>We like that bold enterprise of Mr
Ruskin's which distinguishes the first
volume, that daring enumeration of
the great palpable facts of nature&mdash;the
sky, the sea, the earth, the foliage&mdash;which
the painter has to represent.
His descriptions are often made indistinct
by a multitude of words; but
there is light in the haze&mdash;there is a
genuine love of nature felt through
them. This is almost the only point
of sympathy we feel with Mr Ruskin;
it is the only hold his volumes have
had over us whilst perusing them; we
may be, therefore, excused if we present
here to our readers a specimen or
two of his happier descriptions of
nature. We will give them <em>the Cloud</em>
and <em>the Torrent</em>. They will confess that,
after reading Mr Ruskin's description
of the clouds, their first feeling will be
an irresistible impulse to throw open
the window, and look upon them again
as they roll through the sky. The
torrent may not be so near at hand,
to make renewed acquaintance with.
We must premise that he has been
enforcing his favourite precept, the
minute, and faithful, and perpetual
study of nature. He very justly scouts
the absurd idea that trees and rocks
and clouds are, under any circumstances,
to be <em>generalised</em>&mdash;so that a
tree is not to stand for an oak or a
poplar, a birch or an elm, but for a
<em>general tree</em>. If a tree is at so great
a distance that you cannot distinguish
what it is, as you cannot paint more
than you see, you must paint it indistinctly.
But to make a purposed
indistinctness where the kind of tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
would be very plainly seen is a manifest
absurdity. So, too, the forms of
clouds should be studied, and as much
as possible taken from nature, and not
certain <em>general clouds</em> substituted at
the artist's pleasure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But it is not the outline only which
is thus systematically false. The drawing
of the solid form is worse still; for it
is to be remembered that, although clouds
of course arrange themselves more or less
into broad masses, with a light side and
a dark side, both their light and shade are
invariably composed of a series of divided
masses, each of which has in its outline
as much variety and character as the
great outline of the cloud; presenting,
therefore, a thousand times repeated, all
that I have described as the general form.
Nor are these multitudinous divisions a
truth of slight importance in the character
of sky, for they are dependent on, and
illustrative of, a quality which is usually
in a great degree overlooked&mdash;the enormous
retiring spaces of solid clouds. Between
the illumined edge of a heaped
cloud and that part of its body which
turns into shadow, there will generally be
a clear distance of several miles&mdash;more or
less, of course, according to the general
size of the cloud; but in such large masses
as Poussin and others of the old masters,
which occupy the fourth or fifth of the
visible sky, the clear illumined breadth of
vapour, from the edge to the shadow,
involves at least a distance of five or six
miles. We are little apt, in watching
the changes of a mountainous range of
cloud, to reflect that the masses of vapour
which compose it are linger and higher
than any mountain-range of the earth;
and the distances between mass and mass
are not yards of air, traversed in an
instant by the flying form, but valleys of
changing atmosphere leagues over; that
the slow motion of ascending curves,
which we can scarcely trace, is a boiling
energy of exulting vapour rushing into the
heaven a thousand feet in a minute; and
that the topling angle, whose sharp edge
almost escapes notice in the multitudinous
forms around it, is a nodding precipice of
storms, three thousand feet from base to
summit. It is not until we have actually
compared the forms of the sky with the
hill-ranges of the earth, and seen the
soaring alp overtopped and buried in one
surge of the sky, that we begin to conceive
or appreciate the colossal scale of
the phenomena of the latter. But of this
there can be no doubt in the mind of any
one accustomed to trace the forms of
cloud among hill-ranges&mdash;as it is there a
demonstrable and evident fact&mdash;that the
space of vapour visibly extended over an
ordinarily clouded sky is not less, from
the point nearest to the observer to the
horizon, than twenty leagues; that the
size of every mass of separate form, if it
be at all largely divided, is to be expressed
in terms of <em>miles</em>; and that every boiling
heap of illuminated mist in the nearer
sky is an enormous mountain, fifteen or
twenty thousand feet in height, six or
seven miles over in illuminated surface,
furrowed by a thousand colossal ravines,
torn by local tempests into peaks and
promontories, and changing its features
with the majestic velocity of a volcano."&mdash;(Vol.
i. p. 228.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The forms of clouds, it seems, are
worth studying: after reading this,
no landscape-painter will be disposed,
with hasty slight invention, to sketch
in these "<em>mountains</em>" of the sky. Here
is his description, or part of it, first of
falling, then of running water. With
the incidental criticism upon painters
we are not at present concerned:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A little crumbling white or lightly-rubbed
paper will soon give the effect of
indiscriminate foam; but nature gives
more than foam&mdash;she shows beneath it,
and through it, a peculiar character of
exquisitely studied form, bestowed on
every wave and line of fall; and it is this
variety of definite character which Turner
always aims at, rejecting as much as possible
everything that conceals or overwhelms
it. Thus, in the Upper Fall of
the Tees, though the whole basin of the
fall is blue, and dim with the rising
vapour, yet the attention of the spectator
is chiefly directed to the concentric zones
and delicate curves of the falling water
itself; and it is impossible to express
with what exquisite accuracy these are
given. They are the characteristic of a
powerful stream descending without impediment
or break, but from a narrow
channel, so as to expand as it falls. They
are the constant form which such a stream
assumes as it descends; and yet I think
it would be difficult to point to another
instance of their being rendered in art.
You will find nothing in the waterfalls,
even of our best painters, but springing
lines of parabolic descent, and splashing
and shapeless foam; and, in consequence,
though they may make you understand
the swiftness of the water, they never let
you feel the weight of it: the stream, in
their hands, looks <em>active</em>, not <em>supine</em>, as if
it leaped, not as if it fell. Now, water
will leap a little way&mdash;it will leap down
a weir or over a stone&mdash;but it <em>tumbles</em>
over a high fall like this; and it is when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
we have lost the parabolic line, and arrived
at the catenary&mdash;when we have
lost the spring of the fall, and arrived at
the <em>plunge</em> of it&mdash;that we begin really to
feel its weight and wildness. Where
water takes its first leap from the top, it
is cool and collected, and uninteresting
and mathematical; but it is when it finds
that it has got into a scrape, and has
farther to go than it thought for, that its
character comes out; it is then that it
begins to writhe and twist, and sweep
out, zone after zone, in wilder stretching
as it falls, and to send down the rocket-like,
lance-pointed, whizzing shafts at its
sides sounding for the bottom. And it is
this prostration, the hopeless abandonment
of its ponderous power to the air,
which is always peculiarly expressed by
Turner....</p>

<p>"When water, not in very great body,
runs in a rocky bed much interrupted by
hollows, so that it can rest every now and
then in a pool as it goes long, it does
not acquire a continuous velocity of motion.
It pauses after every leap, and
curdles about, and rests a little, and then
goes on again; and if, in this comparatively
tranquil and rational state of mind,
it meets with any obstacle, as a rock or
stone, it parts on each side of it with a
little bubbling foam, and goes round: if it
comes to a step in its bed, it leaps it
lightly, and then, after a little splashing
at the bottom, stops again to take breath.
But if its bed be on a continuous slope,
not much interrupted by hollows, so that
it cannot rest&mdash;or if its own mass be so
increased by flood that its usual resting-places
are not sufficient for it, but that it
is perpetually pushed out of them by the
following current before it has had time
to tranquillise itself&mdash;it of course gains
velocity with every yard that it runs;
the impetus got at one leap is carried to
the credit of the next, until the whole
stream becomes one mass of unchecked
accelerating motion. Now, when water
in this state comes to an obstacle, it does
not part at it, but clears it like a racehorse;
and when it comes to a hollow, it
does not fill it up, and run out leisurely at
the other side, but it rushes down into it,
and comes up again on the other side, as
a ship into the hollow of the sea. Hence
the whole appearance of the bed of the
stream is changed, and all the lines of the
water altered in their nature. The quiet
stream is a succession of leaps and pools;
the leaps are light and springy and parabolic,
and make a great deal of splashing
when they tumble into the pool; then we
have a space of quiet curdling water, and
another similar leap below. But the
stream, when it has gained an impetus,
takes the shape of its bed, never stops, is
equally deep and equally swift everywhere,
goes down into every hollow, not
with a leap, but with a swing&mdash;not foaming
nor splashing, but in the bending
line of a strong sea-wave, and comes up
again on the other side, over rock and
ridge, with the ease of a bounding leopard.
If it meet a rock three or four
feet above the level of its bed, it will
neither part nor foam, nor express any
concern about the matter, but clear it in
a smooth dome of water without apparent
exertion, coming down again as smoothly
on the other side, the whole surface of
the surge being drawn into parallel lines
by its extreme velocity, but foamless,
except in places where the form of the
bed opposes itself at some direct angle to
such a line of fall, and causes a breaker;
so that the whole river has the appearance
of a deep and raging sea, with this
only difference, that the torrent waves
always break backwards, and sea-waves
forwards. Thus, then, in the water which
has gained an impetus, we have the most
exquisite arrangement of curved lines,
perpetually changing from convex to concave,
following every swell and hollow of
the bed with their modulating grace, and
all in unison of motion, presenting perhaps
the most beautiful series of inorganic
forms which nature can possibly
produce."&mdash;(Vol. i. p. 363.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the object of Mr Ruskin, in his
first volume of <cite>Modern Painters</cite>, to
show what the artist has to do in his
imitation of nature. We have no
material controversy to raise with him
on this subject; but we cannot help
expressing our surprise that he should
have thought it necessary to combat,
with so much energy, so very primitive
a notion that the imitation of the
artist partakes of the nature of a <em>deception</em>,
and that the highest excellence
is obtained when the representation
of any object is taken for the
object itself. We thought this matter
had been long ago settled. In a page
or two of Quatremère de Quincy's
treatise on <cite>Imitation in the Fine Arts</cite>,
the reader, if he has still to seek on this
subject, will find it very briefly and
lucidly treated. The aim of the artist
is not to produce such a representation
as shall be taken, even for a moment,
for a real object. His aim is, by
imitating certain qualities or attributes
of the object, to reproduce for
us those pleasing or elevating impressions
which it is the nature of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
qualities or attributes to excite. We
have stated very briefly the accepted
doctrine on this subject&mdash;so generally
accepted and understood that Mr
Ruskin was under no necessity to
avoid the use of the word imitation,
as he appears to have done, under the
apprehension that it was incurably
infected with this notion of an attempted
deception. Hardly any reader
of his book, even without a word of
explanation, would have attached any
other meaning to it than what he himself
expresses by representation of
certain "truths" of nature.</p>

<p>With respect to the imitations of
the landscape-painter, the notion of a
deception cannot occur. His trees
and rivers cannot be mistaken, for an
instant, for real trees and rivers, and
certainly not while they stand there
in the gilt frame, and the gilt frame
itself against the papered wall. His
only chance of deception is to get rid
of the frame, convert his picture into
a transparency, and place it in the
space which a window should occupy.
In almost all cases, deception is obtained,
not by painting well, but by
those artifices which disguise that
what we see <em>is</em> a painting. At the
same time, we are not satisfied with an
expression which several writers, we
remark, have lately used, and which
Mr Ruskin very explicitly adopts. The
imitations of the landscape-painter are
not a "language" which he uses; they
are not mere "signs," analogous to
those which the poet or the orator
employs. There is no analogy between
them. Let us analyse our impressions
as we stand before the artist's landscape,
not thinking of the artist, or
his dexterity, but simply absorbed in
the pleasure which he procures us&mdash;we
do not find ourselves reverting, in
imagination, to <em>other</em> trees or other
rivers than those he has depicted.
We certainly do not believe them to
be real trees, but neither are they
mere signs, or a language to recall such
objects; but <em>what there is of tree there</em>
we enjoy. There is the coolness and
the quiet of the shaded avenue, and
we feel them; there is the sunlight on
that bank, and we feel its cheerfulness;
we feel the serenity of his river.
He has brought the spirit of the trees
around us; the imagination rests in
the picture. In other departments of
art the effect is the same. If we
stand before a head of Rembrandt or
Vandyke, we do not think that it
lives; but neither do we think of some
other head, of which that is the type.
But there is majesty, there is thought,
there is calm repose, there is some
phase of humanity expressed before
us, and we are occupied with so much
of human life, or human character, as
is then and there given us.</p>

<p>Imitate as many qualities of the
real object as you please, but always
the highest, never sacrificing a truth
of the mind, or the heart, for one only
of the sense. Truth, as Mr Ruskin
most justly says&mdash;truth always. When
it is said that truth should not be
always expressed, the maxim, if properly
understood, resolves into this&mdash;that
the higher truth is not to be
sacrificed to the lower. In a landscape,
the gradation of light and shade
is a more important truth than the
exact brilliancy (supposing it to be
attainable,) of any individual object.
The painter must calculate what
means he has at his disposal for representing
this gradation of light, and
he must pitch his tone accordingly.
Say he pitches it far below reality, he
is still in search of truth&mdash;of contrast
and degree.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may happen that, by
rendering one detail faithfully, an
artist may give a false impression,
simply because he cannot render other
details or facts by which it is accompanied
in nature. Here, too, he would
only sacrifice truth <em>in the cause of
truth</em>. The admirers of Constable
will perhaps dispute the aptness of our
illustration. Nevertheless his works
appear to us to afford a curious example
of a scrupulous accuracy or
detail producing a false impression.
Constable, looking at foliage under
the sunlight, and noting that the leaf,
especially after a shower, will reflect
so much light that the tree will seem
more white than green, determined to
paint all the white he saw. Constable
could paint white leaves. So far so
well. But then these leaves in nature
are almost always in motion: they
are white at one moment and green
the next. We never have the impression
of a white leaf; for it is seen
playing with the light&mdash;its mirror, for
one instant, and glancing from it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
next. Constable could not paint
motion. He could not imitate this
shower of light in the living tree. He
must leave his white paint where he
has once put it. Other artists before
him had seen the same light, but,
knowing that they could not bring
the breeze into their canvass, they
wisely concluded that less white paint
than Constable uses would produce a
more truthful impression.</p>

<p>But we must no longer be detained
from the more immediate task before
us. We must now follow Mr Ruskin
to his second volume of <cite>Modern
Painters</cite>, where he explains his theory
of the beautiful; and although this
will not be to readers in general the
most attractive portion of his writings,
and we ourselves have to practise
some sort of self-denial in fixing
our attention upon it, yet manifestly
it is here that we must look for the
basis or fundamental principles of all
his criticisms in art. The order in
which his works have been published
was apparently deranged by a generous
zeal, which could brook no delay,
to defend Mr Turner from the censures
of the undiscerning public. If the
natural or systematic order had been
preserved, the materials of this second
volume would have formed the first
preliminary treatise, determining
those broad principles of taste, or
that philosophical theory of the beautiful,
on which the whole of the subsequent
works were to be modelled.
Perhaps this broken and reversed order
of publication has not been unfortunate
for the success of the author&mdash;perhaps
it was dimly foreseen to be
not altogether impolitic; for the popular
ear was gained by the bold and
enthusiastic defence of a great painter;
and the ear of the public, once caught,
may be detained by matter which, in
the first instance, would have appealed
to it in vain. Whether the effect of
chance or design, we may certainly
congratulate Mr Ruskin on the fortunate
succession, and the fortunate
rapidity with which his publications
have struck on the public ear. The
popular feeling, won by the zeal and
intrepidity of the first volume of
<cite>Modern Painters</cite>, was no doubt a little
tried by the graver discussions of the
second. It was soon, however, to be
again caught, and pleased by a bold
and agreeable miscellany under the
magical name of "The Seven Lamps;"
and these Seven Lamps could hardly
fail to throw some portion of their
pleasant and bewildering light over a
certain rudimentary treatise upon
building, which was to appear under
the title of "The Stones of Venice."</p>

<p>We cannot, however, congratulate
Mr Ruskin on the manner in which he
has acquitted himself in this arena of
philosophical inquiry, nor on the sort
of theory of the Beautiful which he
has contrived to construct. The least
metaphysical of our readers is aware
that there is a controversy of long
standing upon this subject, between
two different schools of philosophy.
With the one the beautiful is described
as a great "idea" of the reason, or an
intellectual intuition, or a simple intuitive
perception; different expressions
are made use of, but all imply
that it is a great primary feeling, or
sentiment, or idea of the human mind,
and as incapable of further analysis
as the idea of space, or the simplest
of our sensations. The rival school
of theorists maintain, on the contrary,
that no sentiment yields more readily
to analysis; and that the beautiful, except
in those rare cases where the
whole charm lies in one sensation, as in
that of colour, is a complex sentiment.
They describe it as a pleasure resulting
from the presence of the visible
object, but of which the visible object
is only in part the immediate cause.
Of a great portion of the pleasure it
is merely the vehicle; and they say
that blended reminiscences, gathered
from every sense, and every human
affection, from the softness of touch
of an infant's finger to the highest
contemplations of a devotional spirit,
have contributed, in their turn, to this
delightful sentiment.</p>

<p>Mr Ruskin was not bound to belong
to either of these schools of philosophy;
he was at liberty to construct
an eclectic system of his own;&mdash;and
he has done so. We shall take the
precaution, in so delicate a matter, of
quoting Mr Ruskin's own words for
the exposition of his own theory.
Meanwhile, as some clue to the reader,
we may venture to say that he agrees
with the first of these schools in
adopting a primary intuitive sentiment
of the beautiful; but then this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
primary intuition is only of a sensational
or "animal" nature&mdash;a subordinate
species of the beautiful, which
is chiefly valuable as the necessary
condition of the higher and truly
beautiful; and this last he agrees
with the opposite school in regarding
as a derived sentiment&mdash;derived by
contemplating the objects of external
nature as types of the Divine attributes.
This is a brief summary of the
theory; for a fuller exposition we
shall have recourse to his own words.</p>

<p>The term <em>Æsthetic</em>, which has been
applied to this branch of philosophy,
Mr Ruskin discards; he offers as a
substitute <em>Theoria</em>, or <em>The Theoretic
Faculty</em>, the meaning of which he
thus explains:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I proceed, therefore, first to examine
the nature of what I have called the
theoretic faculty, and to justify my substitution
of the term 'Theoretic' for
'Æsthetic,' which is the one commonly
employed with reference to it.</p>

<p>"Now the term 'æsthesis' properly
signifies mere sensual perception of the
outward qualities and necessary effects
of bodies; in which sense only, if we
would arrive at any accurate conclusions
on this difficult subject, it should always
be used. But I wholly deny that the
impressions of beauty <em>are in any way sensual</em>;&mdash;they
are neither sensual nor intellectual,
<em>but moral</em>; and for the faculty
receiving them, whose difference from
mere perception I shall immediately endeavour
to explain, no terms can be more
accurate or convenient than that employed
by the Greeks, 'Theoretic,' which
I pray permission, therefore, always to
use, and to call the operation of the
faculty itself, Theoria."&mdash;(P. 11.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We are introduced to a new faculty
of the human mind; let us see what
new or especial sphere of operation is
assigned to it. After some remarks
on the superiority of the mere sensual
pleasures of the eye and the ear, but
particularly of the eye, to those derived
from other organs of sense, he
continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Herein, then, we find very sufficient
ground for the higher estimation of these
delights: first, in their being eternal and
inexhaustible; and, secondly, in their being
evidently no meaner instrument of life,
but an object of life. Now, in whatever
is an object of life, in whatever may be
infinitely and for itself desired, we may
be sure there is something of divine: for
God will not make anything an object of
life to his creatures which does not point
to, or partake of himself,"&mdash;[a bold assertion.]
"And so, though we were to regard
the pleasures of sight merely as the
highest of sensual pleasures, and though
they were of rare occurrence&mdash;and, when
occurring, isolated and imperfect&mdash;there
would still be supernatural character
about them, owing to their self-sufficiency.
But when, instead of being scattered,
interrupted, or chance-distributed,
they are gathered together and so arranged
to enhance each other, as by
chance they could not be, there is caused
by them, not only a feeling of strong
affection towards the object in which
they exist, but a perception of purpose
and adaptation of it to our desires; a
perception, therefore, of the immediate
operation of the Intelligence which so
formed us and so feeds us.</p>

<p>"Out of what perception arise Joy,
Admiration, and Gratitude?</p>

<p>"Now, the mere animal consciousness
of the pleasantness I call Æsthesis; but
the exulting, reverent, and grateful perception
of it I call Theoria. For this,
and this only, is the full comprehension
and contemplation of the beautiful as a
gift of God; a gift not necessary to our
being, but adding to and elevating it,
and twofold&mdash;first, of the desire; and,
secondly, of the thing desired."</p></blockquote>

<p>We find, then, that in the production
of the full sentiment of the beautiful
<em>two</em> faculties are employed, or
two distinct operations denoted. First,
there is the "animal pleasantness
which we call Æsthesis,"&mdash;which
sometimes appears confounded with
the mere pleasures of sense, but which
the whole current of his speculations
obliges us to conclude is some separate
intuition of a sensational character;
and, secondly, there is "the exulting,
reverent, and grateful perception of
it, which we call Theoria," which
alone is the truly beautiful, and which
it is the function of the Theoretic Faculty
to reveal to us. But this new
Theoretic Faculty&mdash;what can it be but
the old faculty of Human Reason,
exercised upon the great subject of
Divine beneficence?</p>

<p>Mr Ruskin, as we shall see, discovers
that external objects are beautiful
because they are types of Divine
attributes; but he admits, and is solicitous
to impress upon our minds,
that the "meaning" of these types is
"learnt." When, in a subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
part of his work, he feels himself
pressed by the objection that many
celebrated artists, who have shown a
vivid appreciation and a great passion
for the beautiful, have manifested
no peculiar piety, have been rather
deficient in spiritual-mindedness, he
gives them over to that instinctive
sense he has called Æsthesis, and
says&mdash;"It will be remembered that I
have, throughout the examination of
typical beauty, asserted our instinctive
sense of it; the moral <em>meaning</em> of it
being only discoverable by reflection,"
(p. 127.) Now, there is no other conceivable
manner in which the meaning
of the type can be learnt than by
the usual exercise of the human reason,
detecting traces of the Divine
power, and wisdom, and benevolence,
in the external world, and then associating
with the various objects of the
external world the ideas we have thus
acquired of the Divine wisdom and
goodness. The rapid and habitual
regard of certain facts or appearances
in the visible world, as types of the
attributes of God, <em>can</em> be nothing else
but one great instance (or class of
instances) of that law of association
of ideas on which the second school
of philosophy we have alluded to so
largely insist. And thus, whether
Mr Ruskin chooses to acquiesce in it
or not, his "Theoria" resolves itself
into a portion, or fragment, of that
theory of association of ideas, to which
he declares, and perhaps believes,
himself to be violently opposed.</p>

<p>In a very curious manner, therefore,
has Mr Ruskin selected his materials
from the two rival schools of
metaphysics. His <em>Æsthesis</em> is an intuitive
perception, but of a mere sensual
or animal nature&mdash;sometimes almost
confounded with the mere pleasure
of sense, at other times advanced
into considerable importance, as where
he has to explain the fact that men
of very little piety have a very acute
perception of beauty. His <em>Theoria</em> is,
and can be, nothing more than the
results of human reason in its highest
and noblest exercise, rapidly brought
before the mind by a habitual association
of ideas. For the lowest element
of the beautiful he runs to the
school of intuitions;&mdash;they will not
thank him for the compliment;&mdash;for
the higher to that analytic school,
and that theory of association of ideas,
to which throughout he is ostensibly
opposed.</p>

<p>This <em>Theoria</em> divides itself into two
parts. We shall quote Mr Ruskin's
own words and take care to quote
from them passages where he seems
most solicitous to be accurate and
explanatory:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first thing, then, we have to do,"
he says, "is accurately to discriminate
and define those appearances from which
we are about to reason as belonging to
beauty, properly so called, and to clear
the ground of all the confused ideas and
erroneous theories with which the misapprehension
or metaphorical use of the
term has encumbered it.</p>

<p>"By the term Beauty, then, properly
are signified two things: first, that external
quality of bodies, already so often
spoken of, and which, whether it occur
in a stone, flower, beast, or in man, is
absolutely identical&mdash;which, as I have
already asserted, may be shown to be in
some sort typical of the Divine attributes,
and which, therefore, I shall, for distinction's
sake, call Typical Beauty; and,
secondarily, the appearance of felicitous
fulfilment of functions in living things,
more especially of the joyful and right
exertion of perfect life in man&mdash;and this
kind of beauty I shall call Vital Beauty."&mdash;(P.
26.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Vital Beauty, as well as the
Typical, partakes essentially, as far
as we can understand our author, of
a religious character. On turning to
that part of the volume where it is
treated of at length, we find a universal
sympathy and spirit of kindliness
very properly insisted on, as one great
element of the sentiment of beauty; but
we are not permitted to dwell upon this
element, or rest upon it a moment,
without some reference to our relation
to God. Even the animals themselves
seem to be turned into types for us
of our moral feelings or duties. We
are expressly told that we cannot
have this sympathy with life and
enjoyment in other creatures, unless
it takes the form of, or comes accompanied
with, a sentiment of piety. In
all cases where the beautiful is anything
higher than a certain "animal
pleasantness," we are to understand
that it has a religious character.
"In all cases," he says, summing up
the functions of the Theoretic Faculty,
"<em>it is something Divine</em>; either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
approving voice of God, the glorious
symbol of Him, the evidence of His
kind presence, or the obedience to His
will by Him induced and supported,"&mdash;(p.
126.) Now it is a delicate task,
when a man errs by the exaggeration
of a great truth or a noble sentiment,
to combat his error; and yet as much
mischief may ultimately arise from
an error of this description as from
any other. The thoughts and feelings
which Mr Ruskin has described, form
the noblest part of our sentiment of
the beautiful, as they form the noblest
phase of the human reason. But they
are not the whole of it. The visible
object, to adopt his phraseology, does
become a type to the contemplative
and pious mind of the attribute of
God, and is thus exalted to our apprehension.
But it is not beautiful
solely or originally on this account.
To assert this, is simply to falsify our
human nature.</p>

<p>Before, however, we enter into these
<em>types</em>, or this typical beauty, it will be
well to notice how Mr Ruskin deals
with previous and opposing theories.
It will be well also to remind our
readers of the outline of that theory
of association of ideas which is here
presented to us in so very confused a
manner. We shall then be better
able to understand the very curious
position our author has taken up in
this domain of speculative philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr Ruskin gives us the following
summary of the "errors" which he
thinks it necessary in the first place
to clear from his path:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those erring or inconsistent positions
which I would at once dismiss are, the
first, that the beautiful is the true; the
second, that the beautiful is the useful;
the third, that it is dependent on custom;
and the fourth, that it is dependent on
the association of ideas."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first of these theories, that the
beautiful is the true, we leave entirely
to the tender mercies of Mr Ruskin;
we cannot gather from his refutation
to what class of theorists he is alluding.
The remaining three are, as we
understand the matter, substantially
one and the same theory. We believe
that no one, in these days, would define
beauty as solely resulting either from
the apprehension of Utility, (that is,
the adjustment of parts to a whole, or
the application of the object to an
ulterior purpose,) or to Familiarity
and the affection which custom engenders;
but they would regard both
Utility and Familiarity as amongst the
sources of those agreeable ideas or
impressions, which, by the great law
of association, became intimately connected
with the visible object. We
must listen, however, to Mr Ruskin's
refutation of them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That the beautiful is the <em>useful</em> is an
assertion evidently based on that limited
and false sense of the latter term which I
have already deprecated. As it is the
most degrading and dangerous supposition
which can be advanced on the subject,
so, fortunately, it is the most palpably
absurd. It is to confound admiration
with hunger, love with lust, and life
with sensation; it is to assert that the
human creature has no ideas and no feelings,
except those ultimately referable to
its brutal appetites. It has not a single
fact, nor appearance of fact, to support it,
and needs no combating&mdash;at least until its
advocates have obtained the consent of
the majority of mankind that the most
beautiful productions of nature are seeds
and roots; and of art, spades and millstones.</p>

<p>"Somewhat more rational grounds
appear for the assertion that the sense of
the beautiful arises from <em>familiarity</em> with
the object, though even this could not
long be maintained by a thinking person.
For all that can be alleged in defence of
such a supposition is, that familiarity
deprives some objects which at first appeared
ugly of much of their repulsiveness;
whence it is as rational to conclude
that familiarity is the cause of beauty, as
it would be to argue that, because it is
possible to acquire a taste for olives,
therefore custom is the cause of lusciousness
in grapes....</p>

<p>"I pass to the last and most weighty
theory, that the agreeableness in objects
which we call beauty is the result of the
association with them of agreeable or
interesting ideas.</p>

<p>"Frequent has been the support and
wide the acceptance of this supposition,
and yet I suppose that no two consecutive
sentences were ever written in
defence of it, without involving either a
contradiction or a confusion of terms.
Thus Alison, 'There are scenes undoubtedly
more beautiful than Runnymede,
yet, to those who recollect the great
event that passed there, there is no scene
perhaps which so strongly seizes on the
imagination,'&mdash;where we are wonder-struck
at the bold obtuseness which
would prove the power of imagination by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
its overcoming that very other power (of
inherent beauty) whose existence the
arguer desires; for the only logical conclusion
which can possibly be drawn
from the above sentence is, that imagination
is <em>not</em> the source of beauty&mdash;for,
although no scene seizes so strongly on
the imagination, yet there are scenes
'more beautiful than Runnymede.' And
though instances of self-contradiction as
laconic and complete as this are rare, yet,
if the arguments on the subject be fairly
sifted from the mass of confused language
with which they are always encumbered,
they will be found invariably to fall into
one of these two forms: either association
gives pleasure, and beauty gives
pleasure, therefore association is beauty;
or the power of association is stronger
than the power of beauty, therefore the
power of association <em>is</em> the power of
beauty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this last sentence is sheer
nonsense, and only proves that the
author had never given himself the
trouble to understand the theory he
so flippantly discards. No one ever
said that "association gives pleasure;"
but very many, and Mr Ruskin
amongst the rest, have said that
associated thought adds its pleasure
to an object pleasing in itself, and
thus increases the complex sentiment
of beauty. That it is a complex
sentiment in all its higher forms, Mr
Ruskin himself will tell us. As to
the manner in which he deals with
Alison, it is in the worst possible
spirit of controversy. Alison was
an elegant, but not a very precise
writer; it was the easiest thing in
the world to select an unfortunate
illustration, and to convict <em>that</em> of
absurdity. Yet he might with equal
ease have selected many other illustrations
from Alison, which would
have done justice to the theory he
expounds. A hundred such will
immediately occur to the reader. If,
instead of a historical recollection of
this kind, which could hardly make
the stream itself of Runnymede look
more beautiful, Alison had confined
himself to those impressions which
the generality of mankind receive
from river scenery, he would have
had no difficulty in showing (as we
believe he has elsewhere done) how,
in this case, ideas gathered from
different sources flow into one harmonious
and apparently simple feeling.
That sentiment of beauty which
arises as we look upon a river will be
acknowledged by most persons to be
composed of many associated thoughts,
combining with the object before them.
Its form and colour, its bright surface
and its green banks, are all that the
eye immediately gives us; but with
these are combined the remembered
coolness of the fluent stream, and of
the breeze above it, and of the
pleasant shade of its banks; and
beside all this&mdash;as there are few persons
who have not escaped with
delight from town or village, to
wander by the quiet banks of some
neighbouring stream, so there are
few persons who do not associate
with river scenery ideas of peace and
serenity. Now many of these
thoughts or facts are such as the eye
does not take cognisance of, yet they
present themselves as instantaneously
as the visible form, and so blended as
to seem, for the moment, to belong to it.</p>

<p>Why not have selected some such
illustration as this, instead of the unfortunate
Runnymede, from a work
where so many abound as apt as they
are elegantly expressed? As to Mr
Ruskin's utilitarian philosopher, it is a
fabulous creature&mdash;no such being exists.
Nor need we detain ourselves
with the quite departmental subject of
Familiarity. But let us endeavour&mdash;without
desiring to pledge ourselves
or our readers to its final adoption&mdash;to
relieve the theory of association of
ideas from the obscurity our author
has thrown around it. Our readers
will not find that this is altogether a
wasted labour.</p>

<p>With Mr Ruskin we are of opinion
that, in a discussion of this kind, the
term Beauty ought to be limited to
the impression derived, mediately or
immediately, from the visible object.
It would be useless affectation to
attempt to restrict the use of the word,
in general, to this application. We
can have no objection to the term
Beautiful being applied to a piece of
music, or to an eloquent composition,
prose or verse, or even to our moral
feelings and heroic actions; the word
has received this general application,
and there is, at basis, a great deal in
common between all these and the
sentiment of beauty attendant on the
visible object. For music, or sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
sounds, and poetry, and our moral
feelings, have much to do (through the
law of association) with our sentiment
of the Beautiful. It is quite
enough if, speaking of the subject of
our analysis, we limit it to those impressions,
however originated, which
attend upon the visible object.</p>

<p>One preliminary word on this association
of ideas. It is from its very
nature, and the nature of human life,
of all degrees of intimacy&mdash;from the
casual suggestion, or the case where
the two ideas are at all times felt to
be distinct, to those close combinations
where the two ideas have apparently
coalesced into one, or require
an attentive analysis to separate
them. You see a mass of iron; you
may be said <em>to see its weight</em>, the impression
of its weight is so intimately
combined with its form. The <em>light</em>
of the sun, and the <em>heat</em> of the sun
are learnt from different senses, yet
we never see the one without thinking
of the other, and the reflection of the
sunbeam seen upon a bank immediately
suggests the idea of <em>warmth</em>.
But it is not necessary that the combination
should be always so perfect
as in this instance, in order to produce
the effect we speak of under the
name of Association of Ideas. It is
hardly possible for us to abstract the
<em>glow</em> of the sunbeam from its light;
but the fertility which follows upon
the presence of the sun, though a
suggestion which habitually occurs to
reflective minds, is an association of a
far less intimate nature. It is sufficiently
intimate, however, to blend
with that feeling of admiration we
have when we speak of the beauty of
the sun. There is the golden harvest
in its summer beams. Again, the
contemplative spirit in all ages has
formed an association between the
sun and the Deity, whether as the
fittest symbol of God, or as being His
greatest gift to man. Here we have
an association still more refined, and
of a somewhat less frequent character,
but one which will be found to enter,
in a very subtle manner, into that impression
we receive from the great
luminary.</p>

<p>And thus it is that, in different
minds, the same materials of thought
may be combined in a closer or laxer
relationship. This should be borne in
mind by the candid inquirer. That
in many instances ideas from different
sources do coalesce, in the manner
we have been describing, he cannot
for an instant doubt. He seems <em>to
see</em> the coolness of that river; he seems
<em>to see</em> the warmth on that sunny bank.
In many instances, however, he must
make allowance for the different habitudes
of life. The same illustration
will not always have the same force
to all men. Those who have cultivated
their minds by different pursuits,
or lived amongst scenery of a different
character, cannot have formed
exactly the same moral association
with external nature.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being adjusted,
what, we ask, is that first original
charm of the <em>visible object</em> which serves
as the foundation for this wonderful
superstructure of the Beautiful, to
which almost every department of
feeling and of thought will be found
to bring its contribution? What is
it so pleasurable that the eye at once
receives from the external world, that
round <em>it</em> should have gathered all
these tributary pleasures? Light&mdash;colour&mdash;form;
but, in reference to our
discussion, pre-eminently the exquisite
pleasure derived from the sense
of light, pure or coloured. Colour,
from infancy to old age, is one original,
universal, perpetual source of
delight, the first and constant element
of the Beautiful.</p>

<p>We are far from thinking that the
eye does not at once take cognisance
of form as well as colour. Some
ingenious analysts have supposed that
the sensation of colour is, in its origin,
a mere mental affection, having no
reference to space or external objects,
and that it obtains this reference
through the contemporaneous acquisition
of the sense of touch. But there
can be no more reason for supposing
that the sense of touch informs us immediately
of an external world than
that the sense of colour does. If we do
not allow to all the senses an intuitive
reference to the external world, we
shall get it from none of them. Dr
Brown, who paid particular attention
to this subject, and who was desirous
to limit the first intimation of the
sense of sight to an abstract sensation
of unlocalised colour, failed entirely
in his attempt to obtain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
any other source the idea of space or
<em>outness</em>; Kant would have given him
certain subjective <em>forms of the sensitive
faculty</em>, space and time. These he
did not like: he saw that, if he denied
to the eye an immediate perception of
the external world, he must also deny
it to the touch; he therefore prayed
in aid certain muscular sensations
from which the idea of <em>resistance</em> would
be obtained. But it seems to us evident
that not till <em>after</em> we have
acquired a knowledge of the external
world can we connect <em>volition</em> with
muscular movement, and that, until
that connection is made, the muscular
sensations stand in the same predicament
as other sensations, and could
give him no aid in solving his problem.
We cannot go further into this
matter at present.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The mere flash
of light which follows the touch upon
the optic nerve represents itself as
something <em>without</em>; nor was colour,
we imagine, ever felt, but under some
<em>form</em> more or less distinct; although
in the human being the eye seems to
depend on the touch far more than in
other animals, for its further instruction.</p>

<p>But although the eye is cognisant
of form as well as colour, it is in the
sensation of colour that we must seek
the primitive pleasure derived from
this organ. And probably the first
reason why form pleases is this, that
the boundaries of form are also the
lines of contrast of colour. It is a
general law of all sensation that, if it
be continued, our susceptibility to it
declines. It was necessary that the eye
should be always open. Its susceptibility
is sustained by the perpetual
contrast of colours. Whether the
contrast is sudden, or whether one
hue shades gradually into another,
we see here an original and primary
source of pleasure. A constant
variety, in some way produced, is
essential to the maintenance of the
pleasure derived from colour.</p>

<p>It is not incumbent on us to inquire
how far the beauty of form may be
traceable to the sensation of touch;&mdash;a
very small portion of it we suspect.
In the human countenance, and in
sculpture, the beauty of form is almost
resolvable into expression; though
possibly the soft and rounded outline
may in some measure be associated
with the sense of smoothness to the
touch. All that we are concerned to
show is, that there is here in colour,
diffused as it is over the whole world,
and perpetually varied, a <em>beauty</em> at
once showered upon the visible object.
We hear it said, if you resolve all into
association, where will you begin?
You have but a circle of feelings. If
moral sentiment, for instance, be not
itself the beautiful, why should it become
so by association. There must
be something else that is <em>the beautiful</em>,
by association with which it passes
for such. We answer, that we do not
resolve <em>all</em> into association; that we
have in this one gift of colour, shed
so bountifully over the whole world,
an original beauty, a delight which
makes the external object pleasant
and beloved; for how can we fail, in
some sort, to love what produces so
much pleasure?</p>

<p>We are at a loss to understand how
any one can speak with disparagement
of colour as a source of the
beautiful. The sculptor may, perhaps,
by his peculiar education, grow comparatively
indifferent to it: we know
not how this may be; but let any
man, of the most refined taste imaginable,
think what he owes to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
source, when he walks out at evening,
and sees the sun set amongst the
hills. The same concave sky, the same
scene, so far as its form is concerned,
was there a few hours before, and saddened
him with its gloom; one leaden
hue prevailed over all; and now in a
clear sky the sun is setting, and the
hills are purple, and the clouds are
radiant with every colour that can be
extracted from the sunbeam. He
can hardly believe that it is the same
scene, or he the same man. Here
the grown-up man and the child stand
always on the same level. As to the
infant, note how its eye feeds upon a
brilliant colour, or the living flame.
If it had wings, it would assuredly do
as the moth does. And take the
most untutored rustic, let him be old,
and dull, and stupid, yet, as long as
the eye has vitality in it, will he look
up with long untiring gaze at this
blue vault of the sky, traversed by its
glittering clouds, and pierced by the
tall green trees around him.</p>

<p>Is it any marvel now that round
the <em>visible object</em> should associate
tributary feelings of pleasure? How
many pleasing and tender sentiments
gather round the rose! Yet the rose
is beautiful in itself. It was beautiful
to the child by its colour, its texture,
its softly-shaded leaf, and the contrast
between the flower and the foliage.
Love, and poetry, and the tender regrets
of advanced life, have contributed
a second dower of beauty.
The rose is more to the youth and to
the old man than it was to the child;
but still to the last they both feel the
pleasure of the child.</p>

<p>The more commonplace the illustration,
the more suited it is to our
purpose. If any one will reflect on
the many ideas that cluster round this
beautiful flower, he will not fail to
see how numerous and subtle may be
the association formed with the visible
object. Even an idea painful in
itself may, by way of contrast, serve
to heighten the pleasure of others with
which it is associated. Here the
thought of decay and fragility, like a
discord amongst harmonies, increases
our sentiment of tenderness. We
express, we believe, the prevailing
taste when we say that there is nothing,
in the shape of art, so disagreeable
and repulsive as artificial
flowers. The waxen flower may be
an admirable imitation, but it is a
detestable thing. This partly results
from the nature of the imitation; a
vulgar deception is often practised
upon us: what is not a flower is intended
to pass for one. But it is
owing still more, we think, to the
contradiction that is immediately
afterwards felt between this preserved
and imperishable waxen flower, and
the transitory and perishable rose.
It is the nature of the rose to bud, and
blossom, and decay; it gives its
beauty to the breeze and to the
shower; it is mortal; it is <em>ours</em>; it
bears our hopes, our loves, our regrets.
This waxen substitute, that
cannot change or decay, is a contradiction
and a disgust.</p>

<p>Amongst objects of man's contrivance,
the sail seen upon the calm
waters of a lake or a river is universally
felt to be beautiful. The form
is graceful, and the movement gentle,
and its colour contrasts well either
with the shore or the water. But
perhaps the chief element of our pleasure
is all association with human life,
with peaceful enjoyment&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To waft me from distraction."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or take one of the noblest objects
in nature&mdash;the mountain. There is
no object except the sea and the sky
that reflects to the sight colours so
beautiful, and in such masses. But
colour, and form, and magnitude,
constitute but a part of the beauty or
the sublimity of the mountain. Not
only do the clouds encircle or rest
upon it, but men have laid on it their
grandest thoughts: we have associated
with it our moral fortitude, and
all we understand of greatness or
elevation of mind; our phraseology
seems half reflected from the mountain.
Still more, we have made it
holy ground. Has not God himself descended
on the mountain? Are not
the hills, once and for ever, "the
unwalled temples of our earth?"
And still there is another circumstance
attendant upon mountain scenery,
which adds a solemnity of its own,
and is a condition of the enjoyment of
other sources of the sublime&mdash;solitude.
It seems to us that the feeling of solitude
almost always associates itself
with mountain scenery. Mrs Somerville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
in the description which she
gives or quotes, in her <cite>Physical Geography</cite>,
of the Himalayas, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The loftiest peaks being bare of snow
gives great variety of colour and beauty
to the scenery, which in these passes is
at all times magnificent. During the
day, the stupendous size of the mountains,
their interminable extent, the variety and
the sharpness of their forms, and, above
all, the tender clearness of their distant
outline melting into the pale blue sky,
contrasted with the deep azure above, is
described as a scene of wild and wonderful
beauty. At midnight, when myriads
of stars sparkle in the black sky, and
the pure blue of the mountains looks
deeper still below the pale white gleam
of the earth and snow-light, the effect is
of unparalleled sublimity, and no language
can describe the splendour of the
sunbeams at daybreak, streaming between
the high peaks, and throwing their
gigantic shadows on the mountains below.
There, far above the habitation of
man, no living thing exists, no sound is
heard; the very echo of the traveller's
footsteps startles him in the awful <em>solitude
and silence</em> that reigns in those
august dwellings of everlasting snow."</p></blockquote>

<p>No one can fail to recognise the
effect of the last circumstance mentioned.
Let those mountains be the
scene of a gathering of any human
multitude, and they would be more
desecrated than if their peaks had
been levelled to the ground. We
have also quoted this description to
show how large a share <em>colour</em> takes
in beautifying such a scene. Colour,
either in large fields of it, or in sharp
contrasts, or in gradual shading&mdash;the
play of light, in short, upon this world&mdash;is
the first element of beauty.</p>

<p>Here would be the place, were we
writing a formal treatise upon this
subject, after showing that there is
in the sense of sight itself a sufficient
elementary beauty, whereto other
pleasurable reminiscences may attach
themselves, to point out some of these
tributaries. Each sense&mdash;the touch,
the ear, the smell, the taste&mdash;blend
their several remembered pleasures
with the object of vision. Even taste,
we say, although Mr Ruskin will
scorn the gross alliance. And we
would allude to the fact to show the
extreme subtilty of these mental processes.
The fruit which you think of
eating has lost its beauty from that
moment&mdash;it assumes to you a quite
different relation; but the reminiscence
that there is sweetness in the
peach or the grape, whilst it remains
quite subordinate to the pleasure derived
from the sense of sight, mingles
with and increases that pleasure.
Whilst the cluster of ripe grapes is
looked at only for its beauty, the idea
that they are pleasant to the taste as
well steals in unobserved, and adds
to the complex sentiment. If this
idea grow distinct and prominent,
the beauty of the grape is gone&mdash;you
eat it. Here, too, would be the place
to take notice of such sources of pleasure
as are derived from adaptation
of parts, or the adaptation of the
whole to ulterior purposes; but here
especially should we insist on human
affections, human loves, human sympathies.
Here, in the heart of man,
his hopes, his regrets, his affections,
do we find the great source of the
beautiful&mdash;tributaries which take their
name from the stream they join,
but which often form the main current.
On that sympathy with which
nature has so wonderfully endowed
us, which makes the pain and pleasure
of all other living things our own
pain and pleasure, which binds us
not only to our fellow-men, but to
every moving creature on the face of
the earth, we should have much to
say. How much, for instance, does
its <em>life</em> add to the beauty of the swan!&mdash;how
much more its calm and placid
life! Here, and on what would follow
on the still more exalted mood of
pious contemplation&mdash;when all nature
seems as a hymn or song of praise to
the Creator&mdash;we should be happy to
borrow aid from Mr Ruskin; his
essay supplying admirable materials
for certain <em>chapters</em> in a treatise on
the beautiful which should embrace
the whole subject.</p>

<p>No such treatise, however, is it our
object to compose. We have said
enough to show the true nature of
that theory of association, as a branch
of which alone is it possible to take
any intelligible view of Mr Ruskin's
<em>Theoria</em>, or "Theoretic Faculty."
His flagrant error is, that he will represent
a part for the whole, and will
distort and confuse everything for the
sake of this representation. Viewed
in their proper limitation, his remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
are often such as every wise and good
man will approve of. Here and there
too, there are shrewd intimations
which the psychological student may
profit by. He has pointed out several
instances where the associations
insisted upon by writers of the school
of Alison have nothing whatever to
do with the sentiment of beauty; and
neither harmonise with, nor exalt it.
Not all that may, in any way, <em>interest</em>
us in an object, adds to its beauty.
"Thus," as Mr Ruskin we think very
justly says, "where we are told
that the leaves of a plant are occupied
in decomposing carbonic acid,
and preparing oxygen for us, we
begin to look upon it with some such
indifference as upon a gasometer. It
has become a machine; some of our
sense of its happiness is gone; its
emanation of inherent life is no longer
pure." The knowledge of the anatomical
structure of the limb is very
interesting, but it adds nothing to the
beauty of its outline. Scientific associations,
however, of this kind, will
have a different æsthetic effect, according
to the degree or the enthusiasm
with which the science has
been studied.</p>

<p>It is not our business to advocate
this theory of association of ideas, but
briefly to expound it. But we may
remark that those who adopt (as Mr
Ruskin has done in one branch of his
subject&mdash;his <em>Æsthesis</em>) the rival theory
of an intuitive perception of the
beautiful, must find a difficulty where
to <em>insert</em> this intuitive perception.
The beauty of any one object is generally
composed of several qualities
and accessories&mdash;to which of these
are we to connect this intuition?
And if to the whole assemblage of
them, then, as each of these qualities
has been shown by its own virtue to
administer to the general effect, we
shall be explaining again by this new
perception what has been already
explained. Select any notorious
instance of the beautiful&mdash;say the
swan. How many qualities and accessories
immediately occur to us as
intimately blended in our minds with
the form and white plumage of the
bird! What were its arched neck and
mantling wings if it were not <em>living</em>?
And how the calm and inoffensive,
and somewhat majestic life it leads,
carries away our sympathies! Added
to which, the snow-white form of the
swan is imaged in clear waters, and
is relieved by green foliage; and if
the bird makes the river more beautiful,
the river, in return, reflects its
serenity and peacefulness upon the
bird. Now all this we seem to see
as we look upon the swan. To which
of these facts separately will you
attach this new intuition? And if
you wait till all are assembled, the
bird is already beautiful.</p>

<p>We are all in the habit of <em>reasoning</em>
on the beautiful, of defending our
own tastes, and this just in proportion
as the beauty in question is of a
high order. And why do we do this?
Because, just in proportion as the
beauty is of an elevated character,
does it depend on some moral association.
Every argument of this kind
will be found to consist of an analysis
of the sentiment. Nor is there anything
derogatory, as some have supposed,
in this analysis of the sentiment;
for we learn from it, at every
step, that in the same degree as men
become more refined, more humane,
more kind, equitable, and pious, will
the visible world become more richly
clad with beauty. We see here an
admirable arrangement, whereby the
external world grows in beauty, as
men grow in goodness.</p>

<p>We must now follow Mr Ruskin a
step farther into the development of
his <em>Theoria</em>. All beauty, he tell us,
<em>is such</em>, in its high and only true character,
because it is a type of one or
more of God's attributes. This, as
we have shown, is to represent one
class of associated thought as absorbing
and displacing all the rest. We
protest against this egregious exaggeration
of a great and sacred source of
our emotions. With Mr Ruskin's
own piety we can have no quarrel;
but we enter a firm and calm protest
against a falsification of our human
nature, in obedience to one sentiment,
however sublime. No good can come
of it&mdash;no good, we mean, to religion
itself. It is substantially the same
error, though assuming a very different
garb, which the Puritans committed.
They disgusted men with
religion, by introducing it into every
law and custom, and detail of human
life. Mr Ruskin would commit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
same error in the department of taste,
over which he would rule so despotically:
he is not content that the
highest beauty shall be religious; he
will permit nothing to be beautiful,
except as it partakes of a religious
character. But there is a vast region
lying between the "animal pleasantness"
of his Æsthesis and the pious
contemplation of his Theoria. There
is much between the human animal
and the saint; there are the domestic
affections and the love they spring
from, and hopes, and regrets, and
aspirations, and the hour of peace and
the hour of repose&mdash;in short, there is
human life. From all human life, as
we have seen, come contributions to
the sentiment of the beautiful, quite
as distinctly traced as the peculiar
class on which Mr Ruskin insists.</p>

<p>If any one descanting upon music
should affirm, that, in the first place,
there was a certain animal pleasantness
in harmony or melody, or both,
but that the real essence of music,
that by which it truly becomes music,
was the perception in harmony or
melody of types of the Divine attributes,
he would reason exactly in
the same manner on music as Mr
Ruskin does on beauty. Nevertheless,
although sacred music is the
highest, it is very plain that there is
other music than the sacred, and that
all songs are not hymns.</p>

<p>Chapter v. of the present volume
bears this title&mdash;<em>Of Typical Beauty.
First, of Infinity, or the type of the
Divine Incomprehensibility.</em>&mdash;A boundless
space will occur directly to the
reader as a type of the infinite; perhaps
it should be rather described as
itself the infinite under one form.
But Mr Ruskin finds the infinite in
everything. That idea which he
justly describes as the incomprehensible,
and which is so profound and
baffling a mystery to the finite being,
is supposed to be thrust upon the
mind on every occasion. Every instance
of variety is made the type of
the infinite, as well as every indication
of space. We remember that, in
the first volume of the <cite>Modern Painters</cite>,
we were not a little startled at being
told that the distinguishing character
of every good artist was, that "he
painted the infinite." Good or bad,
we now see that he could scarcely
fail to paint the infinite: it must be
by some curious chance that the feat
is not accomplished.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, not only," writes Mr Ruskin,
"is this expression of infinity in distance
most precious wherever we find it, however
solitary it may be, and however unassisted
by other forms and kinds of
beauty; but it is of such value that no
such other forms will altogether recompense
us for its loss; and much as I dread
the enunciation of anything that may
seem like a conventional rule, I have no
hesitation in asserting that no work of
any art, in which this expression of infinity
is possible, can be perfect or supremely
elevated without it; and that, in proportion
to its presence, <em>it will exalt and render
impressive even the most tame and trivial
themes</em>. And I think if there be any
one grand division, by which it is at all
possible to set the productions of painting,
so far as their mere plan or system
is concerned, on our right and left hands,
it is this of light and dark background,
of heaven-light and of object-light....
There is a spectral etching of Rembrandt,
a presentation of Christ in the Temple,
where the figure of a robed priest stands
glaring by its gems out of the gloom,
holding a crosier. Behind it there is a
subdued window-light seen in the opening,
between two columns, without which
the impressiveness of the whole subject
would, I think, be incalculably diminished.
I cannot tell whether I am at
present allowing too much weight to my
own fancies and predilections; but, without
so much escape into the outer air and
open heaven as this, I can take permanent
pleasure in no picture.</p>

<p>"And I think I am supported in this
feeling by the unanimous practice, if not
the confessed opinion, of all artists. The
painter of portrait <em>is unhappy without his
conventional white stroke under the sleeve</em>,
or beside the arm-chair; the painter of
interiors feels like a caged bird unless he
can throw a window open, or set the door
ajar; the landscapist dares not lose himself
in forest without a gleam of light
under its farthest branches, nor ventures
out in rain unless he may somewhere
pierce to a better promise in the distance,
or cling to some closing gap of variable
blue above."&mdash;(P. 39.)</p></blockquote>

<p>But if an open window, or "that
conventional white stroke under the
sleeve," is sufficient to indicate the
Infinite, how few pictures there must
be in which it is not indicated! and
how many "a tame and trivial
theme" must have been, by this indication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
exalted and rendered impressive!
And yet it seems that some
very celebrated paintings want this
open-window or conventional white
stroke. The Madonna della Sediola
of Raphael is known over all Europe;
some print of it may be seen in every
village; that virgin-mother, in her
antique chair, embracing her child
with so sweet and maternal an embrace,
has found its way to the heart
of every woman, Catholic or Protestant.
But unfortunately it has a
dark background, and there is no
open window&mdash;nothing to typify infinity.
To us it seemed that there was
"heaven's light" over the whole picture.
Though there is the chamber
wall seen behind the chair, there is
nothing to intimate that the door or
the window is closed. One might in
charity have imagined that the light
came directly through an open door
or window. However, Mr Ruskin is
inexorable. "Raphael," he says,
"<em>in his full</em>, betrayed the faith he had
received from his father and his master,
and substituted for the radiant
sky of the Madonna del Cardellino
the chamber wall of the Madonna
della Sediola, and the brown wainscot
of the Baldacchino."</p>

<p>Of other modes in which the Infinite
is represented, we have an instance in
"The Beauty of Curvature."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first of these is the curvature of
lines and surfaces, wherein it at first appears
futile to insist upon any resemblance
or suggestion of infinity, since
there is certainly, in our ordinary contemplation
of it, no sensation of the kind.
But I have repeated again and again that
the ideas of beauty are instinctive, and
that it is only upon consideration, and
even then in doubtful and disputable
way, that they appear in their typical
character; neither do I intend at all to
insist upon the particular meaning which
they appear to myself to bear, but merely
on their actual and demonstrable agreeableness;
so that in the present case,
which I assert positively, and have no
fear of being able to prove&mdash;that a curve
of any kind is more beautiful than a right
line&mdash;I leave it to the reader to accept or
not, as he pleases, <em>that reason of its agreeableness
which is the only one that I can at
all trace: namely, that every curve divides
itself infinitely by its changes of direction</em>."&mdash;(P.
63.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Our old friend Jacob Boehmen
would have been delighted with this
Theoria. But we must pass on to
other types. Chapter vi. treats <em>of
Unity, or the Type of the Divine Comprehensiveness</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of the appearances of Unity, or of
Unity itself, there are several kinds, which
it will be found hereafter convenient to
consider separately. Thus there is the
unity of different and separate things,
subjected to one and the same influence,
which may be called Subjectional Unity;
and this is the unity of the clouds, as they
are driven by the parallel winds, or as
they are ordered by the electric currents;
this is the unity of the sea waves; this, of
the bending and undulation of the forest
masses; and in creatures capable of Will
it is the Unity of Will, or of Impulse.
And there is Unity of Origin, which we
may call Original Unity, which is of
things arising from one spring or source,
and speaking always of this their brotherhood;
and this in matter is the unity of
the branches of the trees, and of the petals
and starry rays of flowers, and of the
beams of light; and in spiritual creatures
it is their filial relation to Him from whom
they have their being. And there is
Unity of Sequence," &amp;c.&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">down another half page. Very little
to be got here, we think. Let us advance
to the next chapter. This is
entitled, <em>Of Repose, or the Type of
Divine Permanence</em>.</p>

<p>It will be admitted on all hands
that nothing adds more frequently to
the charms of the visible object than
the associated feeling of repose. The
hour of sunset is the hour of repose.
Most beautiful things are enhanced
by some reflected feeling of this kind.
But surely one need not go farther
than to human labour, and human
restlessness, anxiety, and passion, to
understand the charm of repose. Mr
Ruskin carries us at once into the
third heaven:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As opposed to passion, changefulness,
or laborious exertion, Repose is the especial
and separating characteristic of the
eternal mind and power; it is the 'I am'
of the Creator, opposed to the 'I become'
of all creatures; it is the sign alike of the
supreme knowledge which is incapable of
surprise, the supreme power which is incapable
of labour, the supreme volition
which is incapable of change; it is the
stillness of the beams of the eternal
chambers laid upon the variable waters
of ministering creatures."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>We must proceed. Chapter viii.
treats <em>Of Symmetry, or the Type of
Divine Justice</em>. Perhaps the nature of
this chapter will be sufficiently indicated
to the reader, now somewhat informed
of Mr Ruskin's mode of thinking,
by the title itself. At all events,
we shall pass on to the next chapter,
ix.&mdash;<em>Of Purity, or the Type of Divine
Energy</em>. Here, the reader will perhaps
expect to find himself somewhat
more at home. One type, at all
events, of Divine Purity has often
been presented to his mind. Light
has generally been considered as the
fittest emblem or manifestation of the
Divine Presence,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That never but in unapproachëd light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dwelt from eternity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">But if the reader has formed any such
agreeable expectation he will be disappointed.
Mr Ruskin travels on no
beaten track. He finds some reasons,
partly theological, partly gathered
from his own theory of the Beautiful,
for discarding this ancient association
of Light with Purity. As the <em>Divine</em>
attributes are those which the visible
object typifies, and by no means the
<em>human</em>, and as Purity, which is "sinlessness,"
cannot, he thinks, be predicted
of the Divine nature, it follows
that he cannot admit Light to be a
type of Purity. We quote the passage,
as it will display the working
of his theory:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It may seem strange to many readers
that I have not spoken of purity in that
sense in which it is most frequently used,
as a type of sinlessness. I do not deny
that the frequent metaphorical use of it
in Scripture may have, and ought to have,
much influence on the sympathies with
which we regard it; and that probably
the immediate agreeableness of it to most
minds arises far more from this source
than from that to which I have chosen to
attribute it. But, in the first place, <em>if it
be indeed in the signs of Divine and not of
human attributes that beauty consists</em>, I see
not how the idea of sin can be formed
with respect to the Deity; for it is the
idea of a relation borne by us to Him,
and not in any way to be attached to His
abstract nature; while the Love, Mercifulness,
and Justice of God I have supposed
to be symbolised by other qualities
of beauty: and I cannot trace any rational
connection between them and the idea of
Spotlessness in matter, nor between this
idea nor any of the virtues which make
up the righteousness of man, except perhaps
those of truth and openness, which
have been above spoken of as more expressed
by the transparency than the
mere purity of matter. So that I conceive
the use of the terms purity, spotlessness,
&amp;c., on moral subjects, to be merely
metaphorical; and that it is rather that
we illustrate these virtues by the desirableness
of material purity, than that we
desire material purity because it is illustrative
of those virtues. I repeat, then,
that the only idea which I think can be
legitimately connected with purity of
matter is this of vital and energetic connection
among its particles."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been compelled to quote
some strange passages, of most difficult
and laborious perusal; but our
task is drawing to an end. The last
of these types we have to mention is
that <em>Of Moderation, or the Type of
Government by Law</em>. We suspect
there are many persons who have
rapidly perused Mr Ruskin's works
(probably <em>skipping</em> where the obscurity
grew very thick) who would be
very much surprised, if they gave a
closer attention to them, at the strange
conceits and absurdities which they
had passed over without examination.
Indeed, his very loose and declamatory
style, and the habit of saying extravagant
things, set all examination
at defiance. But let any one pause a
moment on the last title we have
quoted from Mr Ruskin&mdash;let him read
the chapter itself&mdash;let him reflect that
he has been told in it that "what we
express by the terms chasteness, refinement,
and elegance," in any work
of art, and more particularly "that
finish" so dear to the intelligent critic,
owe their attractiveness to being types
of God's government by law!&mdash;we
think he will confess that never in any
book, ancient or modern, did he meet
with an absurdity to outrival it.</p>

<p>We have seen why the curve in
general is beautiful; we have here
the reason given us why one curve is
more beautiful than another:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And herein we at last find the reason
of that which has been so often noted
respecting the subtilty and almost invisibility
of natural curves and colours, and
why it is that we look on those lines as
least beautiful which fall into wide and
far license of curvature, and as most
beautiful which approach nearest (so that
the curvilinear character be distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
asserted) to the government of the right
line, as in the pure and severe curves
of the draperies of the religious
painters."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is still the subject of "vital
beauty" before us, but we shall probably
be excused from entering
further into the development of
"Theoria." It must be quite clear
by this time to our readers, that,
whatever there is in it really wise
and intelligible, resolves itself into
one branch of that general theory
of association of ideas, of which
Alison and others have treated.
But we are now in a condition to
understand more clearly that peculiar
style of language which startled us so
much in the first volume of the <cite>Modern
Painters</cite>. There we frequently
heard of the Divine mission of the
artist, of the religious office of the
painter, and how Mr Turner was
delivering God's message to man.
What seemed an oratorical climax,
much too frequently repeated, proves
to be a logical sequence of his theoretical
principles. All true beauty is
religious; therefore all true art, which
is the reproduction of the beautiful,
must be religious also. Every picture
gallery is a sort of temple, every
great painter a sort of prophet. If
Mr Ruskin is conscious that he never
admires anything beautiful in nature
or art, without a reference to some
attribute of God, or some sentiment
of piety, he may be a very exalted
person, but he is no type of humanity.
If he asserts this, we must be sufficiently
courteous to believe him; we
must not suspect that he is hardly
candid with us, or with himself; but
we shall certainly not accept him as
a representative of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i>.
He finds "sermons in stones," and
sermons always; "books in the running
brooks," and always books of
divinity. Other men not deficient in
reflection or piety do not find it thus.
Let us hear the poet who, more than
any other, has made a religion of the
beauty of nature. Wordsworth, in a
passage familiar to every one of his
readers, runs his hand, as it were,
over all the chords of the lyre. He
finds other sources of the beautiful
not unworthy his song, besides that
high contemplative piety which he
introduces as a noble and fit climax.
He recalls the first ardours of his
youth, when the beautiful object
itself of nature seemed to him all,
in all:&mdash;</p>

<p>Our poet sounds all the chords.
He does not muffle any; he honours

human heart, as well as when she is
informed with that sublime spirit</p>

<p>Sit down, by all means, amongst
the fern and the wild-flowers, and
look out upon the blue hills, or near
you at the flowing brook, and thank
God, the giver of all this beauty.
But what manner of good will you do
by endeavouring to persuade yourself
that these objects <em>are</em> only beautiful
because you give thanks for them?&mdash;for
to this strange logical inversion
will you find yourself reduced. And
surely you learned to esteem and love
this benevolence itself, first as a
human attribute, before you became
cognisant of it as a Divine attribute.
What other course can the mind take
but to travel through humanity up to
God?</p>

<p>There is much more of metaphysics
in the volume before us; there is, in
particular, an elaborate investigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of the faculty of imagination; but we
have no inducement to proceed further
with Mr Ruskin in these psychological
inquiries. We have given some
attention to his theory of the Beautiful,
because it lay at the basis of a
series of critical works which, partly
from their boldness, and partly from
the talent of a certain kind which is
manifestly displayed in them, have
attained to considerable popularity.
But we have not the same object for
prolonging our examination into his
theory of the Imaginative Faculty.
"We say it advisedly," (as Mr Ruskin
always adds when he is asserting
anything particularly rash,) we say it
advisedly, and with no rashness whatever,
that though our author is a man
of great natural ability, and enunciates
boldly many an independent isolated
truth, yet of the spirit of philosophy
he is utterly destitute. The calm,
patient, prolonged thinking, which
Dugald Stewart somewhere describes
as the one essential characteristic of
the successful student of philosophy,
he knows nothing of. He wastes his
ingenuity in making knots where
others had long since untied them.
He rushes at a definition, makes a
parade of classification; but for any
great and wide generalisation he has
no appreciation whatever. He appears
to have no taste, but rather an antipathy
for it; when it lies in his way
he avoids it. On this subject of the
Imaginative Faculty he writes and he
raves, defines and poetises by turns;
makes laborious distinctions where
there is no essential difference; has
his "Imagination Associative," and
his "Imagination Penetrative;" and
will not, or cannot, see those broad
general principles which with most
educated men have become familiar
truths, or truisms. But what clear
thinking can we expect of a writer
who thus describes his "Imagination
Penetrative?"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It may seem to the reader that I am
incorrect in calling this penetrating possession-taking
faculty Imagination. Be
it so: the name is of little consequence;
the Faculty itself, called by what name
it will, I insist upon as the highest
intellectual power of man. <em>There is no
reasoning in it</em>; it works not by algebra,
nor by integral calculus; it is a piercing
Pholas-like mind's tongue, that works
and tastes into the very rock-heart. No
matter what be the subject submitted to
it, substance or spirit&mdash;all is alike
divided asunder, joint and marrow, whatever
utmost truth, life, principle, it has
laid bare; and that which has no truth,
life, nor principle, dissipated into its
original smoke at a touch. The whispers
at men's ears it lifts into visible angels.
Vials that have lain sealed in the deep
sea a thousand years it unseals, and
brings out of them Genii."&mdash;(P. 156.)</p></blockquote>

<p>With such a wonder-working
faculty man ought to do much. Indeed,
unless it has been asleep all
this time, it is difficult to understand
why there should remain anything
for him to do.</p>

<p>Surveying Mr Ruskin's works on
art, with the knowledge we have here
acquired of his intellectual character
and philosophical theory, we are at no
loss to comprehend that mixture of
shrewd and penetrating remark, of
bold and well-placed censure, and of
utter nonsense in the shape of general
principles, with which they abound.
In his <cite>Seven Lamps of Architecture</cite>,
which is a very entertaining book,
and in his <cite>Stones of Venice</cite>, the reader
will find many single observations
which will delight him, as well by
their justice, as by the zeal and
vigour with which they are expressed.
But from neither work will he derive
any satisfaction if he wishes to carry
away with him broad general views
on architecture.</p>

<p>There is no subject Mr Ruskin has
treated more largely than that of
architectural ornament; there is none
on which he has said more good things,
or delivered juster criticisms; and
there is none on which he has uttered
more indisputable nonsense. Every
reader of taste will be grateful to Mr
Ruskin if he can pull down from St
Paul's Cathedral, or wherever else
they are to be found, those wreaths or
festoons of carved flowers&mdash;"that
mass of all manner of fruit and flowers
tied heavily into a long bunch, thickest
in the middle, and pinned up by
both ends against a dead wall."
Urns with pocket-handkerchiefs upon
them, or a sturdy thick flame for
ever issuing from the top, he will
receive our thanks for utterly demolishing.
But when Mr Ruskin expounds
his principles&mdash;and he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
has principles to expound&mdash;when he
lays down rules for the government of
our taste in this matter, he soon involves
us in hopeless bewilderment.
Our ornaments, he tells us, are to be
taken from the works of nature, not
of man; and, from some passages of
his writings, we should infer that Mr
Ruskin would cover the walls of our
public buildings with representations
botanical and geological. But in this
we must be mistaken. At all events,
nothing is to be admitted that is taken
from the works of man.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I conclude, then, with the reader's
leave, that all ornament is base which
takes for its subject human work; that it
is utterly base&mdash;painful to every rightly
toned mind, without, perhaps, immediate
sense of the reason, but for a reason palpable
enough when we do think of it.
For to carve our own work, and set it up
for admiration, is a miserable self-complacency,
a contentment in our wretched
doings, when we might have been looking
at God's doings."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this, can we venture to admire
the building itself, which is, of necessity,
man's own "wretched doing?"</p>

<p>Perplexed by his own rules, he will
sometimes break loose from the entanglement
in some such strange manner
as this:&mdash;"I believe the right
question to ask, with respect to all
ornament, is simply this: Was it done
with enjoyment&mdash;<em>was the carver happy
while he was about it</em>?" Happy art!
where the workman is sure to give
happiness if he is but happy at his
work. Would that the same could be
said of literature!</p>

<p>How far <em>colour</em> should be introduced
into architecture is a question with
men of taste, and a question which of
late has been more than usually discussed.
Mr Ruskin leans to the introduction
of colour. His taste may
be correct; but the fanciful reasoning
which he brings to bear upon the subject
will assist no one else in forming
his own taste. Because there is no
connection "between the spots of an
animal's skin and its anatomical
system," he lays it down as the first
great principle which is to guide us
in the use of colour in architecture&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That it be <em>visibly independent of
form</em>. Never paint a column with vertical
lines, but always cross it. Never
give separate mouldings separate colours,"
&amp;c. "In certain places," he continues,
"you may run your two systems closer,
and here and there let them be parallel
for a note or two, but see that the colours
and the forms coincide only as two
orders of mouldings do; the same for an
instant, but each holding its own course.
So single members may sometimes have
single colours; <em>as a bird's head is sometimes
of one colour, and its shoulders
another, you may make your capital one
colour, and your shaft another</em>; but, in
general, the best place for colour is on
broad surfaces, not on the points of interest
in form. <em>An animal is mottled on
its breast and back, and rarely on its paws
and about its eyes</em>; so put your variegation
boldly on the flat wall and broad shaft,
but be shy of it on the capital and moulding."&mdash;(<cite>Lamps
of Architecture</cite>, p. 127.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not quite see what we have
to do at all with the "anatomical
system" of the animal, which is kept
out of sight; but, in general, we
apprehend there is, both in the animal
and vegetable kingdom, considerable
harmony betwixt colour and external
form. Such fantastic reasoning as
this, it is evident, will do little towards
establishing that one standard
of taste, or that "one school of architecture,"
which Mr Ruskin so strenuously
insists upon. All architects are
to resign their individual tastes and
predilections, and enrol themselves in
one school, which shall adopt one style.
We need not say that the very first
question&mdash;what that style should be,
Greek or Gothic&mdash;would never be
decided. Mr Ruskin decides it in
favour of the "earliest English decorated
Gothic;" but seems, in this
case, to suspect that his decision will
not carry us far towards unanimity.
The scheme is utterly impossible;
but he does his duty, he tells us, by
proposing the impossibility.</p>

<p>As a climax to his inconsistency
and his abnormal ways of thinking,
he concludes his <cite>Seven Lamps of
Architecture</cite> with a most ominous
paragraph, implying that the time is
at hand when no architecture of any
kind will be wanted: man and his
works will be both swept away from
the face of the earth. How, with this
impression on his mind, could he have
the heart to tell us to build for posterity?
Will it be a commentary
on the Apocalypse that we shall next
receive from the pen of Mr Ruskin?</p>

<h2>PORTUGUESE POLITICS.</h2>


<p>The dramatic and singular revolution
of which Portugal has recently
been the theatre, the strange fluctuations
and ultimate success of Marshal
Saldanha's insurrection, the narrow
escape of Donna Maria from at least
a temporary expulsion from her dominions,
have attracted in this country
more attention than is usually bestowed
upon the oft-recurring convulsions of
the Peninsula. Busy as the present
year has been, and abounding in
events of exciting interest nearer
home, the English public has yet
found time to deplore the anarchy
to which Portugal is a prey, and to
marvel once more, as it many times
before has marvelled, at the tardy
realisation of those brilliant promises
of order, prosperity, and good government,
so long held out to the two
Peninsular nations by the promoters
of the Quadruple Alliance. The
statesmen who, for nearly a score of
years, have assiduously guided Portugal
and Spain in the seductive paths
of modern Liberalism, can hardly feel
much gratification at the results of
their well-intended but most unprosperous
endeavours. It is difficult
to imagine them contemplating with
pride and exultation, or even without
a certain degree of self-reproach, the
fruits of their officious exertions.
Repudiating partisan views of Peninsular
politics, putting persons entirely
out of the question, declaring our absolute
indifference as to who occupies
the thrones of Spain and Portugal, so
long as those countries are well-governed,
casting no imputations
upon the motives of those foreign
governments and statesmen who
were chiefly instrumental in bringing
about the present state of things
south of the Pyrenees, we would look
only to facts, and crave an honest
answer to a plain question. The
question is this: After the lapse of
seventeen years, what is the condition
of the two nations upon which
have been conferred, at grievous expense
of blood and treasure, the much
vaunted blessings of rulers nominally
Liberal, and professedly patriotic?
For the present we will confine this
inquiry to Portugal, for the reason
that the War of Succession terminated
in that country when it was but beginning
in the neighbouring kingdom,
since which time the vanquished party,
unlike the Carlists in Spain, have
uniformly abstained&mdash;with the single
exception of the rising in 1846-7&mdash;from
armed aggression, and have observed
a patient and peaceful policy.
So that the Portuguese Liberals have
had seventeen years' fair trial of their
governing capacity, and cannot allege
that their efforts for their country's
welfare have been impeded or retarded
by the acts of that party whom they
denounced as incapable of achieving
it,&mdash;however they may have been
neutralised by dissensions and anarchy
in their own ranks.</p>

<p>At this particular juncture of Portuguese
affairs, and as no inappropriate
preface to the only reply that can
veraciously be given to the question
we have proposed, it will not be amiss
to take a brief retrospective glance at
some of the events that preceded and
led to the reign of Donna Maria. It
will be remembered that from the year
1828 to 1834, the Liberals in both
houses of the British Parliament, supported
by an overwhelming majority
of the British press, fiercely and pertinaciously
assailed the government
and person of Don Miguel, then <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
facto</i> King of Portugal, king <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de jure</i>
in the eyes of the Portuguese Legitimists
and by the vote of the Legitimate
Cortes of 1828, and recognised
(in 1829) by Spain, by the United
States, and by various inferior powers.
Twenty years ago political passions
ran high in this country: public men
were, perhaps, less guarded in their
language; newspapers were certainly
far more intemperate in theirs; and
we may safely say, that upon no
foreign prince, potentate, or politician,
has virulent abuse&mdash;proceeding
from such respectable sources&mdash;ever
since been showered in England, in
one half the quantity in which it then
descended upon the head of the unlucky
Miguel. Unquestionably Don
Miguel had acted, in many respects,
neither well nor wisely: his early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
education had been ill-adapted to the
high position he was one day to fill&mdash;at
a later period of his life he was
destined to take lessons of wisdom
and moderation in the stern but
wholesome school of adversity. But
it is also beyond a doubt, now that
time has cleared up much which then
was purposely garbled and distorted,
that the object of all this invective
was by no means so black as he was
painted, and that his character suffered
in England from the malicious
calumnies of Pedroite refugees, and
from the exaggerated and easily-accepted
statements of the Portuguese
correspondents of English newspapers.
The Portuguese nation, removed from
such influence, formed its own opinions
from what it saw and observed; and
the respect and affection testified, even
at the present day, to their dethroned
sovereign, by a large number of its
most distinguished and respectable
members, are the best refutation of
the more odious of the charges so
abundantly brought against him, and
so lightly credited in those days of
rampant revolution. It is unnecessary,
therefore, to argue that point,
even were personal vindication or
attack the objects of this article,
instead of being entirely without its
scope. Against the insupportable
oppression exercised by the monster
in human form, as which Don Miguel
was then commonly depicted in England
and France, innumerable engines
were directed by the governments and
press of those two countries. Insurrections
were stirred up in Portugal,
volunteers were recruited abroad,
irregular military expeditions were
encouraged, loans were fomented;
money-lenders and stock-jobbers were
all agog for Pedro, patriotism, and
profit. Orators and newspapers foretold,
in glowing speeches and enthusiastic
paragraphs, unbounded prosperity
to Portugal as the sure consequence
of the triumph of the revolutionary
party. Rapid progress of
civilisation, impartial and economical
administration, increase of commerce,
development of the country's resources,
a perfect avalanche of social
and political blessings, were to descend,
like manna from heaven, upon
the fortunate nation, so soon as the
Liberals obtained the sway of its
destinies. It were beside our purpose
here to investigate how it was
that, with such alluring prospects
held out to them, the people of Portugal
were so blind to their interests
as to supply Don Miguel with men
and money, wherewith to defend himself
for five years against the assaults
and intrigues of foreign and domestic
enemies. Deprived of support and
encouragement from without, he still
held his ground; and the formation of
a quadruple alliance, including the
two most powerful countries in Europe,
the enlistment of foreign mercenaries
of a dozen different nations, the
entrance of a numerous Spanish army,
were requisite finally to dispossess
him of his crown. The anomaly of
the abhorred persecutor and tyrant
receiving so much support from his
ill-used subjects, even then struck
certain men in this country whose
names stand pretty high upon the list
of clear-headed and experienced politicians,
and the Duke of Wellington,
Lord Aberdeen, Sir Robert Peel,
Lord Lyndhurst, and others, defended
Miguel; but their arguments, however
cogent, were of little avail against the
fierce tide of popular prejudice, unremittingly
stimulated by the declamations
of the press. To be brief,
in 1834 Don Miguel was driven
from Portugal; and his enemies, put
in possession of the kingdom and
all its resources, were at full liberty
to realise the salutary reforms they
had announced and promised, and for
which they had professed to fight.
On taking the reins of government,
they had everything in their favour;
their position was advantageous and
brilliant in the highest degree. They
enjoyed the prestige of a triumph,
undisputed authority, powerful foreign
protection and influence. At their
disposal was an immense mass of
property taken from the church, as
well as the produce of large foreign
loans. Their credit, too, was <em>then</em> unlimited.
Lastly&mdash;and this was far
from the least of their advantages&mdash;they
had in their favour the great
discouragement and discontent engendered
amongst the partisans of the
Miguelite government, by the numerous
and gross blunders which that
government had committed&mdash;blunders
which contributed even more to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
downfall than did the attacks of its
foes, or the effects of foreign hostility.
In short, the Liberals were complete
and undisputed masters of the situation.
But, notwithstanding all the
facilities and advantages they enjoyed,
what has been the condition of Portugal
since they assumed the reins?
What <em>is</em> its condition at the present
day? We need not go far to ascertain
it. The wretched plight of that
once prosperous little kingdom is deposed
to by every traveller who visits
it, and by every English journal that
has a correspondent there; it is to be
traced in the columns of every Portuguese
newspaper, and is admitted
and deplored by thousands who once
were strenuous and influential supporters
of the party who promised so
much, and who have performed so
little that is good. The reign of that
party whose battle-cry is, or was,
Donna Maria and the Constitution,
has been an unbroken series of revolutions,
illegalities, peculations, corruptions,
and dilapidations. The
immense amount of misnamed "national
property" (the <em>Infantado</em> and
church estates,) which was part of
their capital on their accession to
power, has disappeared without benefit
either to the country or to its
creditors. The treasury is empty;
the public revenues are eaten up by
anticipation; civil and military officers,
the court itself, are all in constant and
considerable arrears of salaries and
pay. The discipline of the troops is
destroyed, the soldiers being demoralised
by the bad example of
their chiefs, including that of Marshal
Saldanha himself; for it is one of the
great misfortunes of the Peninsula,
that there most officers of a certain
rank consider their political predilections
before their military duty. The
"Liberal" party, divided and subdivided,
and split into fractions, whose
numbers fluctuate at the dictates of
interest or caprice, presents a lamentable
spectacle of anarchy and inconsistency;
whilst the Queen herself,
whose good intentions we by no means
impugn, has completely forfeited, as
a necessary consequence of the misconduct
of her counsellors, and of the
sufferings the country has endured
under her reign, whatever amount of
respect, affection, and influence the
Portuguese nation may once have
been disposed to accord her. Such is
the sad picture now presented by
Portugal; and none whose acquaintance
with facts renders them competent
to judge, will say that it is overcharged
or highly coloured.</p>

<p>The party in Portugal who advocate
a return to the ancient constitution,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
under which the country
flourished&mdash;which fell into abeyance
towards the close of the seventeenth
century, but which it is now proposed
to revive, as preferable to, and practically
more liberal than, the present
system&mdash;and who adopt as a banner,
and couple with this scheme, the
name of Don Miguel de Bragança,
have not unnaturally derived great
accession of strength, both moral and
numerical, from the faults and dissensions
of their adversaries. At the
present day there are few things
which the European public, and especially
that of this country, sooner
becomes indifferent to, and loses
sight of, than the person and pretensions
of a dethroned king; and
owing to the lapse of years, to
his unobtrusive manner of life, and
to the storm of accusations amidst
which he made his exit from power,
Don Miguel would probably be considered,
by those persons in this
country who remember his existence,
as the least likely member of the
royal triumvirate, now assembled in
Germany, to exchange his exile for a
crown. But if we would take a fair
and impartial view of the condition of
Portugal, and calculate, as far as is
possible in the case of either of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
two Peninsular nations, the probabilities
and chances of the future, we
must not suffer ourselves to be run
away with by preconceived prejudices,
or to be influenced by the popular
odium attached to a name. After
beholding the most insignificant and
unpromising of modern pretenders
suddenly elevated to the virtual
sovereignty&mdash;however transitory it
may prove&mdash;of one of the most powerful
and civilised of European nations,
it were rash to denounce as impossible
any restoration or enthronement.
And it were especially rash so to do
when with the person of the aspirant
to the throne a nation is able to connect
a reasonable hope of improvement
in its condition. Of the principle
of legitimacy we here say nothing,
for it were vain to deny that in
Europe it is daily less regarded,
whilst it sinks into insignificance
when put in competition with the
rights and wellbeing of the people.</p>

<p>As far back as the period of its
emigration, the Pedroite or Liberal
party split into two fractions. One
of these believed in the possible realisation
of those ultra-liberal theories so
abundantly promulgated in the proclamations,
manifestoes, preambles of
laws, &amp;c., which Don Pedro issued
from the Brazils, from England and
France, and afterwards from Terceira
and Oporto. The other fraction of
the party had sanctioned the promulgation
of these utopian theories as a
means of delusion, and as leading to
their own triumph; but they deemed
their realisation impossible, and were
quite decided, when the revolutionary
tide should have borne them into
power, to oppose to the unruly flood
the barrier of a gradual but steady
reaction. At a later period these
divisions of the Liberal party became
more distinctly defined, and resulted,
in 1836, in their nominal classification
as Septembrists and Chartists&mdash;the
latter of whom (numerically very
weak, but comprising Costa Cabral,
and other men of talent and energy)
may be compared to the Moderados
of Spain&mdash;the former to the Progresistas,
but with tendencies more
decidedly republican. It is the ambitious
pretensions, the struggles for
power and constant dissensions of
these two sets of men, and of the
minor fractions into which they have
subdivided themselves, that have kept
Portugal for seventeen years in a
state of anarchy, and have ended by
reducing her to her present pitiable
condition. So numerous are the divisions,
so violent the quarrels of the
two parties, that their utter dissolution
appears inevitable; and it is in
view of this that the National party,
as it styles itself, which inscribes
upon its flag the name of Don Miguel&mdash;not
as an absolute sovereign, but
with powers limited by legitimate
constitutional forms, to whose strict
observance they bind him as a condition
of their support, and of his
continuance upon the throne upon
which they hope to place him&mdash;uplifts
its head, reorganises its hosts, and
more clearly defines its political principles.
Whilst Chartists and Septembrists
tear each other to pieces, the
Miguelites not only maintain their
numerical importance, but, closing
their ranks and acting in strict
unity, they give constant proofs of
adhesion to Don Miguel as personifying
a national principle, and at the
same time give evidence of political
vitality by the activity and progress
of their ideas, which are adapting
themselves to the Liberal sentiments
and theories of the times.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And it
were flying in the face of facts to deny
that this party comprehends a very
important portion of the intelligence
and respectability of the nation. It
ascribes to itself an overwhelming
majority in the country, and asserts
that five-sixths of the population of
Portugal would joyfully hail its advent
to power. This of course must be
viewed as an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-parte</i> statement, difficult
for foreigners to verify or refute.
But of late there have been no lack of
proofs that a large proportion of the
higher orders of Portuguese are steadfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in their aversion to the government
of the "Liberals," and in their
adherence to him whom they still,
after his seventeen years' dethronement,
persist in calling their king, and
whom they have supported, during
his long exile, by their willing contributions.
It is fresh in every one's
memory that, only the other day,
twenty five peers, or successors of
peers, who had been excluded by Don
Pedro from the peerage for having
sworn allegiance to his brother, having
been reinstated and invited to
take their seats in the Chamber, signed
and published a document utterly rejecting
the boon. Some hundreds of
officers of the old army of Don Miguel,
who are living for the most part in
penury and privation, were invited to
demand from Saldanha the restitution
of their grades, which would have
entitled them to the corresponding
pay. To a man they refused, and
protested their devotion to their
former sovereign. A new law of
elections, with a very extended franchise&mdash;nearly
amounting, it is said, to
universal suffrage&mdash;having been the
other day arbitrarily decreed by the
Saldanha cabinet (certainly a most
unconstitutional proceeding,) and the
government having expressed a wish
that all parties in the kingdom should
exercise the electoral right, and
give their votes for representatives
in the new parliament, a numerous
and highly respectable meeting of the
Miguelites was convened at Lisbon.
This meeting voted, with but two
dissentient voices, a resolution of
abstaining from all share in the
elections, declaring their determination
not to sanction, by coming forward
either as voters or candidates, a system
and an order of things which they
utterly repudiated as illegal, oppressive,
and forced upon the nation by
foreign interference. The same resolution
was adopted by large assemblages
in every province of the kingdom.
At various periods, during the
last seventeen years, the Portuguese
government has endeavoured to inveigle
the Miguelites into the representative
assembly, doubtless hoping
that upon its benches they would be
more accessible to seduction, or easier
to intimidate. It is a remarkable
and significant circumstance, that only
in one instance (in the year 1842)
have their efforts been successful, and
that the person who was then induced
so to deviate from the policy of his
party, speedily gave unmistakable
signs of shame and regret. Bearing
in mind the undoubted and easily
proved fact that the Miguelites, whether
their numerical strength be or be
not as great as they assert, comprise
a large majority of the clergy, of the
old nobility, and of the most highly
educated classes of the nation, their
steady and consistent refusal to sanction
the present order of things, by
their presence in its legislative assembly,
shows a unity of purpose and
action, and a staunch and dogged
conviction, which cannot but be disquieting
to their adversaries, and
over which it is impossible lightly to
pass in an impartial review of the
condition and prospects of Portugal.</p>

<p>We have already declared our determination
here to attach importance
to the persons of none of the four
princes and princesses who claim or
occupy the thrones of Spain and Portugal,
except in so far as they may
respectively unite the greatest amount
of the national suffrage and adhesion.
As regards Don Miguel, we
are far from exaggerating his personal
claims&mdash;the question of legitimacy
being here waived. His prestige <em>out</em>
of Portugal is of the smallest, and
certainly he has never given proofs of
great talents, although he is not altogether
without kingly qualities, nor
wanting in resolution and energy;
whilst his friends assert, and it is fair
to admit as probable, that he has long
since repented and abjured the follies
and errors of his youth. But we
cannot be blind to the fact of the
strong sympathy and regard entertained
for him by a very large number
of Portuguese. His presence in
London during some weeks of the
present summer was the signal for a
pilgrimage of Portuguese noblemen
and gentlemen of the best and most
influential families in the country,
many of whom openly declared the
sole object of their journey to be
to pay their respects to their exiled
sovereign; whilst others, the chief
motive of whose visit was the attraction
of the Industrial Exhibition,
gladly seized the opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
reiterate the assurances of their
fidelity and allegiance. Strangely
enough, the person who opened the
procession was a nephew of Marshal
Saldanha, Don Antonio C. de Seabra,
a staunch and intelligent royalist,
whose visit to London coincided, as
nearly as might be, with his uncle's
flight into Galicia, and with his triumphant
return to Oporto after the
victory gained for him as he was
decamping. Senhor Seabra was followed
by two of the Freires, nephew
and grand-nephew of the Freire who
was minister-plenipotentiary in London
some thirty years ago; by the
Marquis and Marchioness of Vianna,
and the Countess of Lapa&mdash;all of the
first nobility of Portugal; by the
Marquis of Abrantes, a relative of
the royal family of Portugal; by a
host of gentlemen of the first families
in the provinces of Beira, Minho,
Tras-os-Montes, &amp;c.&mdash;Albuquerques,
Mellos, Taveiras, Pachecos, Albergarias,
Cunhas, Correa-de-Sas, Beduidos,
San Martinhos, Pereiras, and
scores of other names, which persons
acquainted with Portugal will
recognise as comprehending much
of the best blood and highest intelligence
in the country. Such
demonstrations are not to be overlooked,
or regarded as trivial and
unimportant. Men like the Marquis
of Abrantes, for instance, not less distinguished
for mental accomplishment
and elevation of character than for
illustrious descent,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> men of large possessions
and extensive influence, cannot
be assumed to represent only
their individual opinions. The remarkable
step lately taken by a number
of Portuguese of this class, must be
regarded as an indication of the state
of feeling of a large portion of the
nation; as an indication, too, of something
grievously faulty in the conduct
or constitution of a government
which, after seventeen years' sway,
has been unable to rally, reconcile, or
even to appease the animosity of any
portion of its original opponents.</p>

<p>Between the state of Portugal and
that of Spain there are, at the present
moment, points of strong contrast,
and others of striking similarity. The
similarity is in the actual condition of
the two countries&mdash;in their sufferings,
misgovernment, and degradation; the
contrast is in the state and prospects
of the political parties they contain.
What we have said of the wretched
plight of Portugal applies, with few
and unimportant differences, to the
condition of Spain. If there has lately
been somewhat less of open anarchy in
the latter country than in the dominions
of Donna Maria, there has not been one
iota less of tyrannical government and
scandalous malversation. The public
revenue is still squandered and robbed,
the heavy taxes extorted from the
millions still flow into the pockets of
a few thousand corrupt officials, ministers
are still stock-jobbers, the liberty
of the press is still a farce,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the
national representation an obscene
comedy. A change of ministry in
Spain is undoubtedly a most interesting
event to those who go out and
those who come in&mdash;far more so in
Spain than in any other country, since
in no other country does the possession
of office enable a beggar so speedily to
transform himself into a <em>millionaire</em>.
In Portugal the will is not wanting, but
the means are less ample. More may
be safely pilfered out of a sack of corn
than out of a sieveful, and poor
little Portugal's revenue does not
afford such scope to the itching palms
of Liberal statesmen as does the more
ample one of Spain, which of late
years has materially increased&mdash;without,
however, the tax-payer and public
creditor experiencing one crumb of
the benefit they might fairly expect in
the shape of reduced imposts and
augmented dividends. But, however
interesting to the governing fraction,
a change of administration in Spain
is contemplated by the governed
masses with supreme apathy and
indifference. They used once to be
excited by such changes; but they
have long ago got over that weakness,
and suffer their pockets to be picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and their bodies to be trampled
with a placidity bordering on the
sublime. As long as things do not
get <em>worse</em>, they remain quiet; they
have little hope of their getting <em>better</em>.
Here, again, in this fertile and beautiful
and once rich and powerful country
of Spain, a most gratifying picture is
presented to the instigators of the
Quadruple Alliance, to the upholders
of the virtuous Christina and the innocent
Isabel! Pity that it is painted
with so ensanguined a brush, and that
strife and discord should be the main
features of the composition! Upon
the first panel is exhibited a civil
war of seven years' duration, vying,
for cold-blooded barbarity and gratuitous
slaughter, with the fiercest and
most fanatical contests that modern
<cite>Times</cite> have witnessed. Terminated
by a strange act of treachery, even
yet imperfectly understood, the war
was succeeded by a brief period of
well-meaning but inefficient government.
By the daring and unscrupulous
man&oelig;uvres of Louis Philippe
and Christina this was upset&mdash;by
means so extraordinary and so disgraceful
to all concerned that scandalised
Europe stood aghast, and almost
refused to credit the proofs
(which history will record) of the
social degradation of Spaniards. For
a moment Spain again stood divided
and in arms, and on the brink of civil
war. This danger over, the blood
that had not been shed in the field
flowed upon the scaffold: an iron
hand and a pampered army crushed
and silenced the disaffection and
murmurs of the great body of the
nation; and thus commenced a system
of despotic and unscrupulous misrule
and corruption, which still endures
without symptom of improvement.
As for the observance of the constitution,
it is a mockery to speak of it,
and has been so any time these eight
years. In June 1850, Lord Palmerston,
in the course of his celebrated
defence of his foreign policy, declared
himself happy to state that the
government of Spain was at that
time carried on more in accordance
with the constitution than it had been
two years previously. As ear-witnesses
upon the occasion, we can do
his lordship the justice to say that the
assurance was less confidently and
unhesitatingly spoken than were most
other parts of his eloquent oration.
It was duly cheered, however, by the
Commons House&mdash;or at least by
those Hispanophilists and philanthropists
upon its benches who accepted
the Foreign Secretary's assurance in
lieu of any positive knowledge of their
own. The grounds for applause and
gratulation were really of the slenderest.
In 1848, the <em>un</em>-constitutional
period referred to by Lord Palmerston,
the Narvaez and Christina government
were in the full vigour of their
repressive measures, shooting the disaffected
by the dozen, and exporting
hundreds to the Philippines or immuring
them in dungeons. This, of course,
could not go on for ever; the power
was theirs, the malcontents were compelled
to succumb; the paternal and
constitutional government made a
desert, and called it peace. Short
time was necessary, when such violent
means were employed, to crush Spain
into obedience, and in 1850 she lay
supine, still bleeding from many an
inward wound, at her tyrants' feet.
This morbid tranquillity might possibly
be mistaken for an indication of an
improved mode of government. As
for any other sign of constitutional
rule, we are utterly unable to discern
it in either the past or the present
year. The admirable observance of
the constitution was certainly in process
of proof, at the very time of
Lord Palmerston's speech, by the
almost daily violation of the liberty
of the press, by the seizure of journals
whose offending articles the authorities
rarely condescended to designate,
and whose incriminated editors were
seldom allowed opportunity of exculpation
before a fair tribunal. It was
further testified to, less than four
months later, by a general election,
at which such effectual use was made
of those means of intimidation and
corruption which are manifold in
Spain, that, when the popular Chamber
assembled, the government was
actually alarmed at the smallness of
the opposition&mdash;limited, as it was, to
about a dozen stray Progresistas,
who, like the sleeping beauty in the
fairy tale, rubbed their eyes in wonderment
at finding themselves there.
Nor were the ministerial forebodings
groundless in the case of the unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and tyrannical Narvaez, who,
within a few months, when seemingly
more puissant than ever, and with an
overwhelming majority in the Chamber
obedient to his nod, was cast
down by the wily hand that had set
him up, and driven to seek safety in
France from the vengeance of his innumerable
enemies. The causes of
this sudden and singular downfall are
still a puzzle and a mystery to the
world; but persons there are, claiming
to see further than their neighbours
into political millstones, who
pretend that a distinguished diplomatist,
of no very long standing at
Madrid, had more to do than was
patent to the world with the disgrace
of the Spanish dictator, whom the
wags of the Puerta del Sol declare to
have exclaimed, as his carriage whirled
him northwards through the gates
of Madrid, "<em>Comme Henri Bulwer!</em>"</p>

<p>Passing from the misgovernment
and sufferings of Spain to its political
state, we experience some difficulty in
clearly defining and exhibiting this,
inasmuch as the various parties that
have hitherto acted under distinct
names are gradually blending and
disappearing like the figures in dissolving
views. In Portugal, as we
have already shown, whilst Chartists
and Septembrists distract the country,
and damage themselves by constant
quarrels and collisions, a
third party, unanimous and determined
in its opposition to those two,
grows in strength, influence, and
prestige. In Spain, <em>no</em> party shows
signs of healthy condition. In all
three&mdash;Moderados, Progresistas, and
Carlists&mdash;symptoms of dissolution are
manifest. In the two countries,
Chartists and Septembrists, Moderados
and Progresistas, have alike split
into two or more factions hostile to
each other; but whilst, in Portugal,
the Miguelites improve their position,
in Spain the Carlist party is reduced
to a mere shadow of its former self.
Without recognised chiefs or able
leaders, without political theory of
government, it bases its pretensions
solely upon the hereditary right of its
head. For whilst Don Miguel, on
several occasions,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has declared his
adhesion to the liberal programme
advocated by his party for the security
of the national liberties, the Count de
Montemolin, either from indecision of
character, or influenced by evil counsels,
has hitherto made no precise,
public, and satisfactory declaration of
his views in this particular,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and by
such injudicious reserve has lost the
suffrages of many whom a distinct
pledge would have gathered round his
banner. Thus has he partially neutralised
the object of his father's abdication
in his favour. Don Carlos was
too completely identified with the old
absolutist party, composed of intolerant
bigots both in temporal and spiritual
matters, ever to have reconciled
himself with the progressive spirit of
the century, or to have become acceptable
to the present generation of
Spaniards. Discerning or advised of
this, he transferred his claims to his
son, thus placing in his hands an
excellent card, which the young prince
has not known how to play. If, instead
of encouraging a sullen and
unprofitable emigration, fomenting
useless insurrections, draining his adherents'
purses, and squandering their
blood, he had husbanded the resources
of the party, clearly and publicly defined
his plan of government&mdash;if ever
seated upon the throne he claims&mdash;and
awaited in dignified retirement the progress
of events, he would not have supplied
the present rulers of Spain with
pretexts, eagerly taken advantage of,
for shameful tyranny and persecution;
and he would have spared himself
the mortification of seeing his party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
dwindle, and his oldest and most
trusted friends and adherents, with few
exceptions, accept pardon and place
from the enemies against whom they
had long and bravely contended. But
vacillation, incapacity, and treachery
presided at his counsels. He had none
to point out to him&mdash;or if any did,
they were unheeded or overruled&mdash;the
fact, of which experience and repeated
disappointments have probably
at last convinced him, that it is not
by the armed hand alone&mdash;not by the
sword of Cabrera, or by Catalonian
guerilla risings&mdash;that he can reasonably
hope ever to reach Madrid, but
by aid of the moral force of public
opinion, as a result of the misgovernment
of Spain's present rulers, of an
increasing confidence in his own merits
and good intentions, and perhaps of
such possible contingencies as a
Bourbon restoration in France, or
the triumph of the Miguelites in
Portugal. This last-named event
will very likely be considered, by that
numerous class of persons who base
their opinions of foreign politics upon
hearsay and general impressions
rather than upon accurate knowledge
and investigation of facts, as
one of the most improbable of possibilities.
A careful and dispassionate
examination of the present
state of the Peninsula does not enable
us to regard it as a case of such utter
improbability. But for the intimate
and intricate connection between the
Spanish and Portuguese questions, it
would by no means surprise us&mdash;bearing
in mind all that Portugal has
suffered and still suffers under her
present rulers&mdash;to see the Miguelite
party openly assume the preponderance
in the country. England would
not allow it, will be the reply. Let us
try the exact value of this assertion.
England has two reasons for hostility
to Don Miguel&mdash;one founded on certain
considerations connected with his
conduct when formerly on the throne
of Portugal, the other on the dynastic
alliance between the two countries.
The government of Donna Maria may
reckon upon the sympathy, advice,
and even upon the direct naval assistance
of England&mdash;up to a certain
point. That is to say, that the English
government will do what it <em>conveniently</em>
and <em>suitably</em> can, in favour
of the Portuguese queen and her
husband; but there is room for a
strong doubt that it would <em>seriously</em>
compromise itself to maintain
them upon the throne. Setting aside
Donna Maria's matrimonial connection,
Don Miguel, as a constitutional
king, and with certain mercantile and
financial arrangements, would suit
English interests every bit as well.
But the case is very different as regards
Spain. The restoration of Don
Miguel would be a terrible if not a
fatal shock to the throne of Isabella II.
and to the Moderado party, to whom
the revival of the legitimist principle
in Portugal would be so much the
more dangerous if experience proved
it to be compatible with the interests
created by the Revolution. For the
Spanish government, therefore, intervention
against Don Miguel is an
absolute necessity&mdash;we might perhaps
say a condition of its existence;
and thus is Spain the great stumbling-block
in the way of his restoration,
whereas England's objections
might be found less invincible. So,
in the civil war in Portugal, this
country only co-operated indirectly
against Don Miguel, and it is by no
means certain he would have been
overcome, but for the entrance of
Rodil's Spaniards, which was the decisive
blow to his cause. And so, the
other day, the English government
was seen patiently looking on at the
progress of events, when it is well
known that the question of immediate
intervention was warmly debated
in the Madrid cabinet, and
might possibly have been carried, but
for the moderating influence of English
counsels.</p>

<p>If we consider the critical and
hazardous position of Marshal Saldanha,
wavering as he is between
Chartists and Septembrists&mdash;threatened
to-day with a Cabralist insurrection,
to-morrow with a Septembrist
pronunciamiento&mdash;it is easy to foresee
that the Miguelite party may soon
find tempting opportunities of an
active demonstration in the field.
Such a movement, however, would be
decidedly premature. Their game
manifestly is to await with patience
the development of the ultimate consequences
of Saldanha's insurrection.
It requires no great amount of judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
and experience in political matters judgment
to foresee that he will be the
victim of his own ill-considered movement,
and that no long period will
elapse before some new event&mdash;be it
a Cabralist reaction or a Septembrist
revolt&mdash;will prove the instability of
the present order of things. With
this certainty in view, the Miguelites
are playing upon velvet. They have
only to hold themselves in readiness
to profit by the struggle between
the two great divisions of the
Liberal party. From this struggle
they are not unlikely to derive an
important accession of strength, if, as
is by no means improbable, the
Chartists should be routed and the
Septembrists remain temporary masters
of the field. To understand the
possible coalition of a portion of the
Chartists with the adherents of Don
Miguel, it suffices to bear in mind
that the former are supporters of constitutional
monarchy, which principle
would be endangered by the triumph
of the Septembrists, whose republican
tendencies are notorious, as is also&mdash;notwithstanding
the momentary truce
they have made with her&mdash;their hatred
to Donna Maria.</p>

<p>The first consequences of a Septembrist
pronunciamiento would probably
be the deposition of the Queen and
the scattering of the Chartists; and in
this case it is easy to conceive the
latter beholding in an alliance with
the Miguelite party their sole chance
of escape from democracy, and from a
destruction of the numerous interests
they have acquired during their many
years of power. It is no unfair inference
that Costa Cabral, when he
caused himself, shortly after his arrival
in London, to be presented to Don
Miguel in a particularly public place,
anticipated the probability of some
such events as we have just sketched,
and thus indicated, to his friends and
enemies, the new service to which he
might one day be disposed to devote
his political talents.</p>

<p>The intricate and suggestive complications
of Peninsular politics offer a
wide field for speculation; but of this
we are not at present disposed further
to avail ourselves, our object being to
elucidate facts rather than to theorise
or indulge in predictions with respect to
two countries by whose political eccentricities
more competent prophets
than ourselves have, upon so many
occasions during the last twenty
years, been puzzled and led astray.
We sincerely wish that the governments
of Spain and Portugal were
now in the hands of men capable of
conciliating all parties, and of averting
future convulsions&mdash;of men sufficiently
able and patriotic to conceive
and carry out measures adapted to the
character, temper, and wants of the
two nations. If, by what we should
be compelled to look upon almost as a
miracle, such a state of things came
about in the Peninsula, we should be
far indeed from desiring to see it disturbed,
and discord again introduced
into the land, for the vindication of
the principle of legitimacy, respectable
though we hold that to be. But if
Spain and Portugal are to continue a
byword among the nations, the focus
of administrative abuses and oligarchical
tyranny; if the lower classes of
society in those countries, by nature
brave and generous, are to remain
degraded into the playthings of egotistical
adventurers, whilst the more
respectable and intelligent portion of
the higher orders stands aloof in disgust
from the orgies of misgovernment;
if this state of things is to
endure, without prospect of amendment,
until the masses throw themselves
into the arms of the apostles of
democracy&mdash;who, it were vain to deny,
gain ground in the Peninsula&mdash;then, we
ask, before it comes to that, would it
not be well to give a chance to parties
and to men whose character and
principles at least unite some elements
of stability, and who, whatever reliance
may be placed on their promises
for the future, candidly admit their
past faults and errors? Assuredly
those nations incur a heavy responsibility,
and but poorly prove their
attachment to the cause of constitutional
freedom, who avail themselves
of superior force to detain feeble allies
beneath the yoke of intolerable abuses.</p>

<h2>THE CONGRESS AND THE AGAPEDOME.</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF PEACE AND LOVE.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>If I were to commence my story
by stating, in the manner of the military
biographers, that Jack Wilkinson
was as brave a man as ever pushed a
bayonet into the brisket of a Frenchman,
I should be telling a confounded
lie, seeing that, to the best of my knowledge,
Jack never had the opportunity
of attempting practical phlebotomy.
I shall content myself with describing
him as one of the finest and best-hearted
fellows that ever held her
Majesty's commission; and no one
who is acquainted with the general
character of the officers of the British
army, will require a higher eulogium.</p>

<p>Jack and I were early cronies at
school; but we soon separated, having
been born under the influence of
different planets. Mars, who had
the charge of Jack, of course devoted
him to the army; Jupiter, who was
bound to look after my interests,
could find nothing better for me than
a situation in the Woods and Forests,
with a faint chance of becoming in
time a subordinate Commissioner&mdash;that
is, provided the wrongs of Ann
Hicks do not precipitate the abolition
of the whole department. Ten years
elapsed before we met; and I regret
to say that, during that interval,
neither of us had ascended many
rounds of the ladder of promotion.
As was most natural, I considered
my own case as peculiarly hard, and
yet Jack's was perhaps harder. He
had visited with his regiment, in the
course of duty, the Cape, the Ionian
Islands, Gibraltar, and the West
Indies. He had caught an ague in
Canada, and had been transplanted
to the north of Ireland by way of a
cure; and yet he had not gained a
higher rank in the service than that
of Lieutenant. The fact is, that Jack
was poor, and his brother officers as
tough as though they had been made of
caoutchouc. Despite the varieties of
climate to which they were exposed,
not one of them would give up the
ghost; even the old colonel, who had
been twice despaired of, recovered
from the yellow fever, and within a
week after was lapping his claret at
the mess-table as jollily as if nothing
had happened. The regiment had a
bad name in the service: they called
it, I believe, "the Immortals."</p>

<p>Jack Wilkinson, as I have said,
was poor, but he had an uncle who
was enormously rich. This uncle,
Mr Peter Pettigrew by name, was
an old bachelor and retired merchant,
not likely, according to the ordinary
calculation of chances, to marry; and
as he had no other near relative save
Jack, to whom, moreover, he was
sincerely attached, my friend was
generally regarded in the light of a
prospective proprietor, and might
doubtless, had he been so inclined,
have negotiated a loan, at or under
seventy per cent, with one of those
respectable gentlemen who are making
such violent efforts to abolish
Christian legislation. But Pettigrew
also was tough as one of "the Immortals,"
and Jack was too prudent a
fellow to intrust himself to hands so
eminently accomplished in the art of
wringing the last drop of moisture
from a sponge. His uncle, he said,
had always behaved handsomely to
him, and he would see the whole tribe
of Issachar drowned in the Dardanelles
rather than abuse his kindness
by raising money on a post-obit.
Pettigrew, indeed, had paid for his
commission, and, moreover, given him
a fair allowance whilst he was quartered
abroad&mdash;circumstances which
rendered it extremely probable that
he would come forward to assist his
nephew so soon as the latter had any
prospect of purchasing his company.</p>

<p>Happening by accident to be in
Hull, where the regiment was quartered,
I encountered Wilkinson, whom
I found not a whit altered for the
worse, either in mind or body, since the
days when we were at school together;
and at his instance I agreed to prolong
my stay, and partake of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
hospitality of the Immortals. A
merry set they were! The major told
a capital story, the senior captain
sung like Incledon, the <em>cuisine</em> was
beyond reproach, and the liquor only
too alluring. But all things must
have an end. It is wise to quit even
the most delightful society before it
palls upon you, and before it is accurately
ascertained that you, clever
fellow as you are, can be, on occasion,
quite as prosy and ridiculous as your
neighbours; therefore on the third
day I declined a renewal of the ambrosial
banquet, and succeeded in persuading
Wilkinson to take a quiet
dinner with me at my own hotel.
He assented&mdash;the more readily, perhaps,
that he appeared slightly depressed
in spirits, a phenomenon not
altogether unknown under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>After the cloth was removed, we
began to discourse upon our respective
fortunes, not omitting the usual
complimentary remarks which, in
such moments of confidence, are applied
to one's superiors, who may be
very thankful that they do not possess
a preternatural power of hearing. Jack
informed me that at length a vacancy
had occurred in his regiment, and that
he had now an opportunity, could he
deposit the money, of getting his captaincy.
But there was evidently a
screw loose somewhere.</p>

<p>"I must own," said Jack, "that it
<em>is</em> hard, after having waited so long,
to lose a chance which may not occur
again for years; but what can I do?
You see I haven't got the money; so
I suppose I must just bend to my
luck, and wait in patience for my
company until my head is as bare as
a billiard-ball!"</p>

<p>"But, Jack," said I, "excuse me
for making the remark&mdash;but won't
your uncle, Mr Pettigrew, assist
you?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest chance of it."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," said I; "I am
very sorry to hear you say so. I
always understood that you were a
prime favourite of his."</p>

<p>"So I was; and so, perhaps, I am,"
replied Wilkinson; "but that don't
alter the matter."</p>

<p>"Why, surely," said I, "if he is
inclined to help you at all, he will not
be backward at a time like this. I
am afraid, Jack, you allow your modesty
to wrong you."</p>

<p>"I shall permit my modesty," said
Jack, "to take no such impertinent
liberty. But I see you don't know my
uncle Peter."</p>

<p>"I have not that pleasure, certainly;
but he bears the character
of a good honest fellow, and everybody
believes that you are to be his
heir."</p>

<p>"That may be, or may not, according
to circumstances," said Wilkinson.
"You are quite right as to his
character, which I would advise no
one to challenge in my presence; for,
though I should never get another
stiver from him, or see a farthing of
his property, I am bound to acknowledge
that he has acted towards me in
the most generous manner. But I
repeat that you don't understand my
uncle."</p>

<p>"Nor ever shall," said I, "unless
you condescend to enlighten me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, listen. Old Peter
would be a regular trump, but for one
besetting foible. He cannot resist a
crotchet. The more palpably absurd
and idiotical any scheme may be, the
more eagerly he adopts it; nay, unless
it <em>is</em> absurd and idiotical, such as
no man of common sense would listen
to for a moment, he will have nothing
to say to it. He is quite shrewd
enough with regard to commercial
matters. During the railway mania,
he is supposed to have doubled his
capital. Never having had any faith
in the stability of the system, he sold
out just at the right moment, alleging
that it was full time to do so, when
Sir Robert Peel introduced a bill
giving the Government the right of
purchasing any line when its dividends
amounted to ten per cent. The result
proved that he was correct."</p>

<p>"It did, undoubtedly. But surely
that is no evidence of his extreme
tendency to be led astray by
crotchets?"</p>

<p>"Quite the reverse: the scheme
was not sufficiently absurd for him.
Besides, I must tell you, that in pure
commercial matters it would be very
difficult to overreach or deceive my
uncle. He has a clear eye for pounds,
shillings, and pence&mdash;principal and
interest&mdash;and can look very well after
himself when his purse is directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
assailed. His real weakness lies in
sentiment."</p>

<p>"Not, I trust, towards the feminine
gender? That might be awkward for
you in a gentleman of his years!"</p>

<p>"Not precisely&mdash;though I would
not like to trust him in the hands of
a designing female. His besetting
weakness turns on the point of the
regeneration of mankind. Forty or
fifty years ago he would have been a
follower of Johanna Southcote. He
subscribed liberally to Owen's schemes,
and was within an ace of turning out
with Thom of Canterbury. Incredible
as it may appear, he actually
was for a time a regular and accepted
Mormonite."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say so?"</p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you, upon my
honour! But for a swindle that Joe
Smith tried to perpetrate about the
discounting of a bill, Peter Pettigrew
might at this moment have been a
leading saint in the temple of Nauvoo,
or whatever else they call the capital
of that polygamous and promiscuous
persuasion."</p>

<p>"You amaze me. How any man
of common sense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just the point. Where
common sense ends, Uncle Pettigrew
begins. Give him a mere thread of
practicability, and he will arrive at a
sound conclusion. Envelope him in
the mist of theory, and he will walk
headlong over a precipice."</p>

<p>"Why, Jack," said I, "you seem
to have improved in your figures of
speech since you joined the army.
That last sentence was worth preservation.
But I don't clearly understand
you yet. What is his present
phase, which seems to stand in the
way of your prospects?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess? What is the
most absurd feature of the present
time?"</p>

<p>"That," said I, "is a very difficult
question. There's Free Trade, and
the proposed Exhibition&mdash;both of
them absurd enough, if you look to
their ultimate tendency. Then there
are Sir Charles Wood's Budget, and
the new Reform Bill, and the Encumbered
Estates Act, and the whole
rubbish of the Cabinet, which they
have neither sense to suppress nor
courage to carry through. Upon my
word, Jack, it would be impossible
for me to answer your question satisfactorily."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the Peace
Congress?" asked Wilkinson.</p>

<p>"As Palmerston does," said I;
"remarkably meanly. But why do
you put that point? Surely Mr Pettigrew
has not become a disciple of the
blatant blacksmith?"</p>

<p>"Read that, and judge for yourself,"
said Wilkinson, handing me over
a letter.</p>

<p>I read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Nephew</span>,&mdash;I have your
letter of the 15th, apprising me of
your wish to obtain what you term a
step in the service. I am aware that
I am not entitled to blame you for a
misguided and lamentably mistaken
zeal, which, to my shame be it
said, I was the means of originally
kindling; still, you must excuse me if,
with the new lights which have been
vouchsafed to me, I decline to assist
your progress towards wholesale homicide,
or lend any farther countenance
to a profession which is subversive of
that universal brotherhood and entire
fraternity which ought to prevail
among the nations. The fact is, Jack,
that, up to the present time, I have
entertained ideas which were totally
false regarding the greatness of my
country. I used to think that England
was quite as glorious from her renown
in arms as from her skill in arts&mdash;that
she had reason to plume herself upon
her ancient and modern victories, and
that patriotism was a virtue which it
was incumbent upon freemen to view
with respect and veneration. Led
astray by these wretched prejudices,
I gave my consent to your enrolling
yourself in the ranks of the British
army, little thinking that, by such a
step, I was doing a material injury to
the cause of general pacification, and,
in fact, retarding the advent of that
millennium which will commence so
soon as the military profession is entirely
suppressed throughout Europe.
I am now also painfully aware that,
towards you individually, I have failed
in performing my duty. I have been
the means of inoculating you with a
thirst for human blood, and of depriving
you of that opportunity of
adding to the resources of your country,
which you might have enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
had I placed you early in one of those
establishments which, by sending exports
to the uttermost parts of the
earth, have contributed so magnificently
to the diffusion of British patterns,
and the growth of American
cotton under a mild system of servitude,
which none, save the minions
of royalty, dare denominate as actual
slavery.</p>

<p>"In short, Jack, I have wronged
you; but I should wrong you still
more were I to furnish you with the
means of advancing one other step in
your bloody and inhuman profession.
It is full time that we should discard
all national recollections. We have
already given a glorious example to
Europe and the world, by throwing
open our ports to their produce
without requiring the assurance of
reciprocity&mdash;let us take another step
in the same direction, and, by a
complete disarmament, convince them
that for the future we rely upon
moral reason, instead of physical force,
as the means of deciding differences.
I shall be glad, my dear boy, to
repair the injury which I have unfortunately
done you, by contributing
a sum, equal to three times the
amount required for the purchase of
a company, towards your establishment
as a partner in an exporting
house, if you can hear of an eligible
offer. Pray keep an eye on the advertising
columns of the <cite>Economist</cite>.
That journal is in every way trustworthy,
except, perhaps, when it
deals in quotation. I must now conclude,
as I have to attend a meeting
for the purpose of denouncing the
policy of Russia, and of warning
the misguided capitalists of London
against the perils of an Austrian loan.
You cannot, I am sure, doubt my
affection, but you must not expect me
to advance my money towards keeping
up a herd of locusts, without
which there would be a general conversion
of swords and bayonets into
machinery&mdash;ploughshares, spades, and
pruning-hooks being, for the present,
rather at a discount.&mdash;I remain always
your affectionate uncle,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Peter Pettigrew</span>.
</p>

<p>"<em>P. S.</em>&mdash;Address to me at Hesse
Homberg, whither I am going as a
delegate to the Peace Congress."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Well, what do you think of
that?" said Wilkinson, when I had
finished this comfortable epistle. "I
presume you agree with me, that I
have no chance whatever of receiving
assistance from that quarter."</p>

<p>"Why, not much I should say,
unless you can succeed in convincing
Mr Pettigrew of the error of his ways.
It seems to me a regular case of monomania."</p>

<p>"Would you not suppose, after
reading that letter, that I was a sort
of sucking tiger, or at best an ogre,
who never could sleep comfortably
unless he had finished off the evening
with a cup of gore?" said Wilkinson.
"I like that coming from old Uncle
Peter, who used to sing Rule Britannia
till he was hoarse, and always dedicated
his second glass of port to the
health of the Duke of Wellington!"</p>

<p>"But what do you intend to do?"
said I. "Will you accept his offer,
and become a fabricator of calicoes?"</p>

<p>"I'd as soon become a field preacher,
and hold forth on an inverted tub!
But the matter is really very serious.
In his present mood of mind, Uncle
Peter will disinherit me to a certainty
if I remain in the army."</p>

<p>"Does he usually adhere long to
any particular crotchet?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, no; and therein lies my
hope. Judging from past experience,
I should say that this fit is not likely
to last above a month or two; still
you see there may be danger in treating
the matter too lightly: besides,
there is no saying when such another
opportunity of getting a step may
occur. What would you advise under
the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"If I were in your place," said I,
"I think I should go over to Hesse
Homberg at once. You need not
identify yourself entirely with the
Peace gentry; you will be near your
uncle, and ready to act as circumstances
may suggest."</p>

<p>"That is just my own notion; and
I think I can obtain leave of absence.
I say&mdash;could you not manage to go
along with me? It would be a real
act of friendship; for, to say the
truth, I don't think I could trust any
of our fellows in the company of the
Quakers."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I believe they can spare
me for a little longer from my official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
duties; and as the weather is fine, I
don't mind if I go."</p>

<p>"That's a good fellow! I shall
make my arrangements this evening;
for the sooner we are off the better."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we were
steaming up the Rhine, a river which,
I trust, may persevere in its attempt
to redeem its ancient character. In
1848, when I visited Germany last,
you might just as well have navigated
the Phlegethon in so far as pleasure
was concerned. Those were the days
of barricades and of Frankfort murders&mdash;of
the obscene German Parliament,
as the junta of rogues, fanatics, and
imbeciles, who were assembled in St
Paul's Church, denominated themselves;
and of every phase and form
of political quackery and insurrection.
Now, however, matters were somewhat
mended. The star of Gagern
had waned. The popularity of the
Archduke John had exhaled like the
fume of a farthing candle. Hecker
and Struve were hanged, shot, or
expatriated; and the peaceably disposed
traveller could once more retire
to rest in his hotel, without being
haunted by a horrid suspicion that
ere morning some truculent waiter
might experiment upon the toughness
of his larynx. I was glad to
observe that the Frankforters appeared
a good deal humbled. They were
always a pestilent set; but during
the revolutionary year their insolence
rose to such a pitch that it was
hardly safe for a man of warm temperament
to enter a shop, lest he
should be provoked by the airs and
impertinence of the owner to commit
an assault upon Freedom in the person
of her democratic votary. I suspect
the Frankforters are now tolerably
aware that revolutions are the
reverse of profitable. They escaped
sack and pillage by a sheer miracle,
and probably they will not again
exert themselves, at least for a considerable
number of years, to hasten
the approach of a similar crisis.</p>

<p>Everybody knows Homberg. On
one pretext or another&mdash;whether the
mineral springs, the baths, the gaiety,
or the gambling&mdash;the integral portions
of that tide of voyagers which
annually fluctuates through the Rheingau,
find their way to that pleasant
little pandemonium, and contribute,
I have no doubt, very largely to the
revenues of that high and puissant
monarch who rules over a population
not quite so large as that comprehended
within the boundaries of
Clackmannan. But various as its
visitors always are, and diverse in
language, habits, and morals, I
question whether Homberg ever exhibited
on any previous occasion so
queer and incongruous a mixture.
Doubtful counts, apocryphal barons,
and chevaliers of the extremest industry,
mingled with sleek Quakers,
Manchester reformers, and clerical
agitators of every imaginable species
of dissent. Then there were women,
for the most part of a middle age,
who, although their complexions
would certainly have been improved
by a course of the medicinal waters,
had evidently come to Homberg on a
higher and holier mission. There was
also a sprinkling of French deputies&mdash;Red
Republicans by principle, who,
if not the most ardent friends of pacification,
are at least the loudest in
their denunciation of standing armies&mdash;a
fair proportion of political exiles,
who found their own countries too
hot to hold them in consequence of
the caloric which they had been
the means of evoking&mdash;and one or two
of those unhappy personages, whose
itch for notoriety is greater than
their modicum of sense. We were
not long in finding Mr Peter Pettigrew.
He was solacing himself
in the gardens, previous to the table-d'hôte,
by listening to the exhilarating
strains of the brass band which
was performing a military march;
and by his side was a lady attired, not
in the usual costume of her sex, but in
a polka jacket and wide trousers,
which gave her all the appearance of
a veteran duenna of a seraglio. Uncle
Peter, however, beamed upon her as
tenderly as though she were a Circassian
captive. To this lady, by name
Miss Lavinia Latchley, an American
authoress of much renown, and a
decided champion of the rights of
woman, we were presented in due
form. After the first greetings were
over, Mr Pettigrew opened the
trenches.</p>

<p>"So Jack, my boy, you have come
to Homberg to see how we carry on
the war, eh? No&mdash;Lord forgive me&mdash;that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
not what I mean. We don't
intend to carry on any kind of war:
we mean to put it down&mdash;clap the
extinguisher upon it, you know; and
have done with all kinds of cannons.
Bad thing, gunpowder! I once sustained
a heavy loss by sending out a
cargo of it to Sierra Leone."</p>

<p>"I should have thought that a
paying speculation," observed Jack.</p>

<p>"Not a whit of it! The cruisers
spoiled the trade; and the missionaries&mdash;confound
them for meddling
with matters which they did not
understand!&mdash;had patched up a peace
among the chiefs of the cannibals;
so that for two years there was
not a slave to be had for love or
money, and powder went down a
hundred and seventy per cent."</p>

<p>"Such are the effects," remarked
Miss Latchley with a sarcastic smile,
which disclosed a row of teeth as
yellow as the buds of the crocus&mdash;"such
are the effects of an ill regulated
and unphilosophical yearning after
the visionary theories of an unopportune
emancipation! Oh that men,
instead of squandering their sympathies
upon the lower grades of creation,
would emancipate themselves
from that network of error and prejudice
which reticulates over the whole
surface of society, and by acknowledging
the divine mission and hereditary
claims of woman, construct a
new, a fairer Eden than any which
was fabled to exist within the confines
of the primitive Chaldæa!"</p>

<p>"Very true, indeed, ma'am!"
replied Mr Pettigrew; "there is a
great deal of sound sense and observation
in what you say. But Jack&mdash;I
hope you intend to become a member
of Congress at once. I shall
be glad to present you at our afternoon
meeting in the character of a
converted officer."</p>

<p>"You are very good, uncle, I am
sure," said Wilkinson, "but I would
rather wait a little. I am certain
you would not wish me to take so
serious a step without mature deliberation;
and I hope that my
attendance here, in answer to your
summons, will convince you that I am
at least open to conviction. In fact,
I wish to hear the argument of your
friends before I come to a definite
decision."</p>

<p>"Very right, Jack; very right!"
said Mr Pettigrew. "I don't like
converts at a minute's notice, as I
remarked to a certain M.P. when he
followed in the wake of Peel. Take
your time, and form your own judgment;
I cannot doubt of the result, if
you only listen to the arguments of
the leading men of Europe."</p>

<p>"And do you reckon America as
nothing, dear Mr Pettigrew?" said
Miss Latchley. "Columbia may not
be able to contribute to the task so
practical and masculine an intellect as
yours, yet still within many a Transatlantic
bosom burns a hate of tyranny
not less intense, though perhaps less
corruscating, than your own."</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it, dear Miss
Latchley!" replied the infatuated
Peter. "A word from you is at any
time worth a lecture, at least if I may
judge from the effects which your
magnificent eloquence has produced
on my own mind. Jack, I suppose
you have never had the privilege of
listening to the lectures of Miss
Latchley?"</p>

<p>Jack modestly acknowledged the
gap which had been left in his education;
stating, at the same time, his
intense desire to have it filled up
at the first convenient opportunity.
Miss Latchley heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not flatter me," she
said, "as is too much the case with
men whose thoughts have been led
habitually to deviate from sincerity.
The worst symptom of the present
age lies in its acquiescence with axioms.
Free us from that, and we are free
indeed; perpetuate its thraldom, and
Truth, which is the daughter of Innocence
and Liberty, imps its wings
in vain, and cannot emancipate itself
from the pressure of that raiment
which was devised to impede its
glorious walk among the nations."</p>

<p>Jack made no reply beyond a glance
at the terminations of the lady, which
showed that she at all events was resolved
that no extra raiment should
trammel her onward progress.</p>

<p>As the customary hour of the table-d'hôte
was approaching, we separated,
Jack and I pledging ourselves to
attend the afternoon meeting of the
Peace Congress, for the purpose of
receiving our first lesson in the
mysteries of pacification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?"
said Jack, as Mr Pettigrew and the
Latchley walked off together. "Hang
me if I don't suspect that old harpy
in the breeches has a design on Uncle
Peter!"</p>

<p>"Small doubt of that," said I; "and
you will find it rather a difficult job
to get him out of her clutches. Your
female philosopher adheres to her victim
with all the tenacity of a polecat."</p>

<p>"Here is a pretty business!" groaned
Jack. "I'll tell you what it is&mdash;I
have more than half a mind to put an
end to it, by telling my uncle what I
think of his conduct, and then leaving
him to marry this harridan, and make
a further fool of himself in any way he
pleases!"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Jack!" said I;
"It will be time enough to do that
after everything else has failed; and,
for my own part, I see no reason to
despair. In the mean time, if you
please, let us secure places at the
dinner-table."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>"Dear friends and well-beloved
brothers! I wish from the bottom of
my heart that there was but one
universal language, so that the general
sentiments of love, equality, and fraternity,
which animate the bosoms of
all the pacificators and detesters of
tyranny throughout the world, might
find a simultaneous echo in your ears,
by the medium of a common speech.
The diversity of dialects, which now
unfortunately prevails, was originally
invented under cover of the feudal
system, by the minions of despotism,
who thought, by such despicable means,
for ever to perpetuate their power.
It is part of the same system which
decrees that in different countries
alien to each other in speech, those
unhappy persons who have sold themselves
to do the bidding of tyrants
shall be distinguished by different
uniforms. O my brothers! see what
a hellish and deep-laid system is here!
English and French&mdash;scarlet against
blue&mdash;different tongues invented, and
different garments prescribed, to inflame
the passions of mankind against
each other, and to stifle their common
fraternity!</p>

<p>"Take down, I say, from your halls
and churches those wretched tatters
of silk which you designate as national
colours! Bring hither, from all parts
of the earth, the butt of the gun and
the shaft of the spear, and all combustible
implements of destruction&mdash;your
fascines, your scaling-ladders,
and your terrible pontoons, that have
made so many mothers childless!
Heap them into one enormous pile&mdash;yea,
heap them to the very stars&mdash;and
on that blazing altar let there be
thrown the Union Jack of Britain,
the tricolor of France, the eagles of
Russia, Austria, and Prussia, the
American stripes and stars, and every
other banner and emblem of that accursed
nationality, through which alone
mankind is defrauded of his birthright.
Then let all men join hands together,
and as they dance around the reeking
pile, let them in one common speech
chaunt a simultaneous hymn in honour
of their universal deliverance, and in
commemoration of their cosmopolitan
triumph!</p>

<p>"O my brothers, O my brothers!
what shall I say further? Ha! I
will not address myself to you whose
hearts are already kindled within you
by the purest of spiritual flames. I
will uplift my voice, and in words of
thunder exhort the debased minions of
tyranny to arouse themselves ere it
be too late, and to shake off those
fetters which they wear for the purpose
of enslaving others. Hear me,
then, ye soldiers!&mdash;hear me, ye
degraded serfs!&mdash;hear me, ye monsters
of iniquity! Oh, if the earth could
speak, what a voice would arise out
of its desolate battle-fields, to testify
against you and yours! Tell us not
that you have fought for freedom.
Was freedom ever won by the sword?
Tell us not that you have defended
your country's rights, for in the eye
of the true philosopher there is no
country save one, and that is the
universal earth, to which all have an
equal claim. Shelter not yourselves,
night-prowling hyenas as you are,
under such miserable pretexts as
these! Hie ye to the charnel-houses,
ye bats, ye vampires, ye ravens, ye
birds of the foulest omen! Strive, if
you can, in their dark recesses, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
hide yourselves from the glare of that
light which is now permeating the
world. O the dawn! O the glory! O
the universal illumination! See, my
brothers, how they shrink, how they
flee from its cheering influence!
Tremble, minions of despotism! Your
race is run, your very empires are
tottering around you. See&mdash;with one
grasp I crush them all, as I crush
this flimsy scroll!"</p>

<p>Here the eloquent gentleman, having
made a paper ball of the last
number of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitung</i>,
sate down amidst the vociferous
applause of the assembly. He was
the first orator who had spoken, and
I believe had been selected to lead
the van on account of his platform
experience, which was very great. I
cannot say, however, that his arguments
produced entire conviction upon
my mind, or that of my companion,
judging from certain muttered adjurations
which fell from Wilkinson, to
the effect that on the first convenient
opportunity he would take means to
make the crumpler-up of nations
atone for his scurrilous abuse of the
army. We were next favoured with
addresses in Sclavonian, German, and
French; and then another British
orator came forward to enlighten the
public. This last was a fellow of
some fancy. Avoiding all stale
topics about despotism, aristocracies,
and standing armies, he went to the
root of the matter, by asserting that
in Vegetarianism alone lay the true
escape from the horrors and miseries
of war. Mr Belcher&mdash;for such was
the name of this distinguished philanthropist&mdash;opined
that without beef and
mutton there never could be a battle.</p>

<p>"Had Napoleon," said he, "been
dieted from his youth upwards upon
turnips, the world would have been
spared those scenes of butchery,
which must ever remain a blot upon
the history of the present century.
One of our oldest English annalists
assures us that Jack Cade, than whom,
perhaps, there never breathed a more
uncompromising enemy of tyranny,
subsisted entirely upon spinach. This
fact has been beautifully treated by
Shakspeare, whose passion for onions
was proverbial, in his play of Henry
VI., wherein he represents Cade, immediately
before his death, as engaged
in the preparation of a salad. I myself,"
continued Mr Belcher in a
slightly flatulent tone, "can assure
this honourable company, that for more
than six months I have cautiously
abstained from using any other kind
of food, except broccoli, which I find
at once refreshing and laxative, light,
airy, and digestible!"</p>

<p>Mr Belcher having ended, a bearded
gentleman, who enjoyed the reputation
of being the most notorious duellist in
Europe, rose up for the purpose of
addressing the audience; but by this
time the afternoon was considerably
advanced, and a large number of the
Congress had silently seceded to
the <em>roulette</em> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge-et-noir</i> tables.
Among these, to my great surprise,
were Miss Latchley and Mr Pettigrew:
it being, as I afterwards understood,
the invariable practice of this
gifted lady, whenever she could secure
a victim, to avail herself of his pecuniary
resources; so that if fortune
declared against her, the gentleman
stood the loss, whilst, in the opposite
event, she retained possession of the
spoil. I daresay some of my readers
may have been witnesses to a similar
arrangement.</p>

<p>As it was no use remaining after
the departure of Mr Pettigrew, Wilkinson
and I sallied forth for a stroll,
not, as you may well conceive, in a
high state of enthusiasm or rapture.</p>

<p>"I would not have believed," said
Wilkinson, "unless I had seen it with
my own eyes, that it was possible to
collect in one room so many samples
of absolute idiocy. What a pleasant
companion that Belcher fellow, who
eats nothing but broccoli, must be!"</p>

<p>"A little variety in the way of
peas would probably render him perfect.
But what do you say to the
first orator?"</p>

<p>"I shall reserve the expression of
my opinion," replied Jack, "until I
have the satisfaction of meeting that
gentleman in private. But how are
we to proceed? With this woman in
the way, it entirely baffles my comprehension."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jack, I was thinking
of that during the whole time of
the meeting; and it does appear to
me that there is a way open by which
we may precipitate the crisis. Mind&mdash;I
don't answer for the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
my scheme, but it has at least the
merit of simplicity."</p>

<p>"Out with it, my dear fellow! I
am all impatience," cried Jack.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "did you
remark the queer and heterogeneous
nature of the company? I don't
think, if you except the Quakers, who
have the generic similarity of eels,
that you could have picked out any
two individuals with a tolerable resemblance
to each other."</p>

<p>"That's likely enough, for they
are a most seedy set. But what of
it?"</p>

<p>"Why, simply this: I suspect the
majority of them are political refugees.
No person, who is not an
absurd fanatic or a designing demagogue,
can have any sympathy
with the nonsense which is talked
against governments and standing
armies. The Red Republicans, of
whom I can assure you there are plenty
in every state in Europe, are naturally
most desirous to get rid of the latter,
by whom they are held in check; and
if that were once accomplished, no
kind of government could stand for
a single day. They are now appealing,
as they call it, to public opinion,
by means of these congresses and
gatherings; and they have contrived,
under cover of a zeal for universal
peace, to induce a considerable number
of weak and foolish people to join with
them in a cry which is simply the
forerunner of revolution."</p>

<p>"All that I understand; but I
don't quite see your drift."</p>

<p>"Every one of these bearded
vagabonds hates the other like poison.
Talk of fraternity, indeed! They want
to have revolution first; and if they
could get it, you would see them
flying at each other's throats like a
pack of wild dogs that have pulled
down a deer. Now, my plan is this:
Let us have a supper-party, and
invite a deputy from each nation.
My life upon it, that before they have
been half-an-hour together, there will
be such a row among the fraternisers
as will frighten your uncle Peter out
of his senses, or, still better, out of
his present crotchet."</p>

<p>"A capital idea! But how shall
we get hold of the fellows?"</p>

<p>"That's not very difficult. They
are at this moment hard at work at
roulette, and they will come readily
enough to the call if you promise them
lots of Niersteiner."</p>

<p>"By George! they shall have it
in bucketfuls, if that can produce the
desired effect. I say&mdash;we must positively
have that chap who abused
the army."</p>

<p>"I think it would be advisable to
let him alone. I would rather stick
to the foreigners."</p>

<p>"O, by Jove, we must have him.
I have a slight score to settle, for
the credit of the service!"</p>

<p>"Well, but be cautious. Recollect
the great matter is to leave our guests
to themselves."</p>

<p>"Never fear me. I shall take care
to keep within due bounds. Now
let us look after Uncle Peter."</p>

<p>We found that respected individual
in a state of high glee. His own
run of luck had not been extraordinary;
but the Latchley, who
appeared to possess a sort of second-sight
in fixing on the fortunate
numbers, had contrived to accumulate
a perfect mountain of dollars, to the
manifest disgust of a profane Quaker
opposite, who, judging from the
violence of his language, had been
thoroughly cleaned out. Mr Pettigrew
agreed at once to the proposal for a
supper-party, which Jack excused
himself for making, on the ground
that he had a strong wish to cultivate
the personal acquaintance of the
gentlemen, who, in the event of his
joining the Peace Society, would
become his brethren. After some
pressing, Mr Pettigrew agreed to take
the chair, his nephew officiating as
croupier. Miss Lavinia Latchley, so
soon as she learned what was in contemplation,
made a strong effort to
be allowed to join the party; but,
notwithstanding her assertion of the
unalienable rights of woman to be
present on all occasions of social
hilarity, Jack would not yield; and
even Pettigrew seemed to think that
there were times and seasons when
the female countenance might be withheld
with advantage. We found no
difficulty whatever in furnishing the
complement of the guests. There
were seventeen of us in all&mdash;four

Sicilian, a Neapolitan, a Roman, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Austrian, a Prussian, a Dane, a
Dutchman, and a Yankee. The majority
exhibited beards of startling
dimension, and few of them appeared
to regard soap in the light of a justifiable
luxury.</p>

<p>Pettigrew made an admirable chairman.
Although not conversant with
any language save his own, he contrived,
by means of altering the terminations
of his words, to carry on a
very animated conversation with all
his neighbours. His Italian was
superb, his Danish above par, and
his Sclavonic, to say the least of it,
passable. The viands were good,
and the wine abundant; so that, by
the time pipes were produced, we
were all tolerably hilarious. The
conversation, which at first was general,
now took a political turn; and
very grievous it was to listen to the
tales of the outrages which some of
the company had sustained at the
hands of tyrannical governments.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,"
said one of the Frenchmen,
"republics are not a whit better than
monarchies, in so far as the liberty of
the people is concerned. Here am I
obliged to leave France, because I was
a friend of that gallant fellow, Ledru
Rollin, whom I hope one day to see
at the head of a real Socialist government.
Ah, won't we set the guillotine
once more in motion then!"</p>

<p>"Property is theft," remarked the
Neapolitan, sententiously.</p>

<p>"I calculate, my fine chap, that
you han't many dollars of your own,
if you're of that way of thinking!"
said the Yankee, considerably scandalised
at this indifference to the rule
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</i>.</p>

<p>"O Roma!" sighed the gentleman
from the eternal city, who was rather
intoxicated.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peste!</i> What is the matter with
it?" asked one of the Frenchmen.
"I presume it stands where it always
did. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garçon&mdash;un petit verre de rhom!</i>"</p>

<p>"How can Rome be what it was,
when it is profaned by the foot of the
stranger?" replied he of the Papal
States.</p>

<p>"<em>Ah, bah!</em> You never were better
off than under the rule of Oudinot."</p>

<p>"You are a German," said the
Hungarian to the Austrian; "what
think you of our brave Kossuth?"</p>

<p>"I consider him a pragmatical ass,"
replied the Austrian curtly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps in that case," interposed
the Lombard, with a sneer that might
have done credit to Mephistopheles,
"the gentleman may feel inclined to
palliate the conduct of that satrap of
tyranny, Radetski?"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;old father Radetski! the
victor in a hundred fights!" cried the
Austrian. "That will I; and spit in
the face of any cowardly Italian who
dares to breathe a word against his
honour!"</p>

<p>The Italian clutched his knife.</p>

<p>"Hold there!" cried the Piedmontese,
who seemed really a decent
sort of fellow. "None of your stiletto
work here! Had you Lombards
trusted more to the bayonet and less
to the knife, we might have given
another account of the Austrian in
that campaign, which cost Piedmont
its king!"</p>

<p>"<em>Carlo Alberto!</em>" hissed the Lombard,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sceleratissimo traditore!</i>"</p>

<p>The reply of the Piedmontese was
a pie-dish, which prostrated the Lombard
on the floor.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! gentlemen! for
Heaven's sake be calm!" screamed
Pettigrew; "remember we are all
brothers!"</p>

<p>"Brothers!" roared the Dane,
"do ye think I would fraternise with
a Prussian? Remember Schleswig
Holstein!"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly calm," said the
Prussian, with the stiff formality of
his nation; "I never quarrel over the
generous vintage of my fatherland.
Come&mdash;let me give you a song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Sie sollen ihm nicht haben<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Den Deutschen freien Rhein.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You never were more mistaken
in your life, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cher</i>," said one of
the Frenchmen, brusquely. "Before
twelve months are over we shall see
who has right to the Rhine!"</p>

<p>"Ay, that is true!" remarked the
Dutchman; "confound these Germans&mdash;they
wanted to annex Luxembourg."</p>

<p>"What says the frog?" asked the
Prussian contemptuously.</p>

<p>The frog said nothing, but he hit
the Prussian on the teeth.</p>

<p>I despair of giving even a feeble
impression of the scene which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
place. No single pair of ears was
sufficient to catch one fourth of the
general discord. There was first an
interchange of angry words; then an
interchange of blows; and immediately
after, the guests were rolling,
in groups of twos and threes, as
suited their fancy, or the adjustment
of national animosities, on the ground.
The Lombard rose not again; the
pie-dish had quieted him for the
night. But the Sicilian and Neapolitan
lay locked in deadly combat,
each attempting with intense animosity
to bite off the other's nose.
The Austrian caught the Hungarian
by the throat, and held him till he
was black in the face. The Dane
pommelled the Prussian. One of the
Frenchmen broke a bottle over the
head of the subject of the Pope;
whilst his friend, thirsting for the
combat, attempted in vain to insult
the remaining non-belligerents. The
Dutchman having done all that honour
required, smoked in mute tranquillity.
Meanwhile the cries of
Uncle Peter were heard above the
din of battle, entreating a cessation
of hostilities. He might as well have
preached to the storm&mdash;the row grew
fiercer every moment.</p>

<p>"This is a disgusting spectacle!"
said the orator from Manchester.
"These men cannot be true pacificators&mdash;they
must have served in the
army."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, old fellow!"
said Jack, turning up the cuffs of his
coat with a very ominous expression
of countenance, "that you were
pleased this morning to use some
impertinent expressions with regard
to the British army. Do you adhere
to what you said then?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then up with your mauleys;
for, by the Lord Harry! I intend to
have satisfaction out of your carcase!"</p>

<p>And in less than a minute the
Manchester apostle dropped with
both his eyes bunged up, and did not
come to time.</p>

<p>"Stranger!" said the Yankee to
the Piedmontese, "are you inclined
for a turn at gouging? This child
feels wolfish to raise hair!" But, to
his credit be it said, the Piedmontese
declined the proposal with a
polite bow. Meanwhile the uproar
had attracted the attention of the
neighbourhood. Six or seven men in
uniform, whom I strongly suspect
to have been members of the brass
band, entered the apartment armed
with bayonets, and carried off the
more obstreperous of the party to the
guard-house. The others immediately
retired, and at last Jack and
I were left alone with Mr Pettigrew.</p>

<p>"And this," said he, after a considerable
pause, "is fraternity and
peace! These are the men who
intended to commence the reign of the
millennium in Europe! Giver me your
hand, Jack, my dear boy&mdash;you shan't
leave the army&mdash;nay, if you do, rely
upon it I shall cut you off with a
shilling, and mortify my fortune to
the Woolwich hospital. I begin to
see that I am an old fool. Stop a
moment. Here is a bottle of wine
that has fortunately escaped the devastation&mdash;fill
your glasses, and let
us dedicate a full bumper to the
health of the Duke of Wellington."</p>

<p>I need hardly say that the toast
was responded to with enthusiasm.
We finished not only that bottle, but
another; and I had the satisfaction
of hearing Mr Pettigrew announce to
my friend Wilkinson that the purchase-money
for his company would
be forthcoming at Coutts's before he
was a fortnight older.</p>

<p>"I won't affect to deny," said
Uncle Peter, "that this is a great disappointment
to me. I had hoped
better things of human nature; but I
now perceive that I was wrong.
Good night, my dear boys! I am a
good deal agitated, as you may see;
and perhaps this sour wine has not
altogether agreed with me&mdash;I had
better have taken brandy and water.
I shall seek refuge on my pillow, and
I trust we may soon meet again!"</p>

<p>"What did the venerable Peter
mean by that impressive farewell?"
said I, after the excellent old man
had departed, shaking his head
mournfully as he went.</p>

<p>"O, nothing at all," said Jack;
"only the Niersteiner has been
rather too potent for him. Have you
any sticking-plaster about you? I
have damaged my knuckles a little
on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</i> of that eloquent
pacificator."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning I was awoke about
ten o'clock by Jack, who came rushing
into my room.</p>

<p>"He's off!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Who's off?" said I.</p>

<p>"Uncle Peter; and, what is far
worse, he has taken Miss Latchley
with him!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>However, it was perfectly true. On
inquiry we found that the enamored
pair had left at six in the morning.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>"Well, Jack," said I, "any tidings
of Uncle Peter?" as Wilkinson entered
my official apartment in London, six
weeks after the dissolution of the
Congress.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;and the case is rather
worse than I supposed," replied Jack
despondingly.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that he
has married that infernal woman in
pantaloons?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, but very
nearly. She has carried him off to
her den; and what she may make of
him there, it is quite impossible to
predict."</p>

<p>"Her den? Has she actually inveigled
him to America?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. These kind of women
have stations established over the
whole face of the earth."</p>

<p>"Where, then, is he located?"</p>

<p>"I shall tell you. In the course of
my inquiries, which, you are aware,
were rather extensive, I chanced to
fall in with a Yarmouth Bloater."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;I meant to
say a Plymouth Brother. Now, these
fellows are a sort of regular kidnappers,
who lie in wait to catch up any
person of means and substance: they
don't meddle with paupers, for, as
you are aware, they share their property
in common: and it occurred to
me rather forcibly, that by means of
my friend, who was a regular trapping
missionary, I might learn something
about my uncle. It cost me an immensity
of brandy to elicit the information;
but at last I succeeded in
bringing out the fact, that my uncle
is at this moment the inmate of an
Agapedome in the neighbourhood of
Southampton, and that the Latchley
is his appointed keeper."</p>

<p>"An Agapedome!&mdash;what the mischief
is that?"</p>

<p>"You may well ask," said Jack;
"but I won't give it a coarser name.
However, from all I can learn, it is
as bad as a Mormonite institution."</p>

<p>"And what the deuce may they
intend to do with him, now they have
him in their power?"</p>

<p>"Fleece him out of every sixpence
of property which he possesses in the
world," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Jack! We must
get him out by some means or other."</p>

<p>"I suspect it would be an easier
job to scale a nunnery. So far as I
can learn, they admit no one into
their premises, unless they have hopes
of catching him as a convert; and I
am afraid that neither you nor I have
the look of likely pupils. Besides,
the Latchley could not fail to recognise
me in a moment."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," said I. "I
think, however, that I might escape
detection by a slight alteration of
attire. The lady did not honour me
with much notice during the half-hour
we spent in her company. I must
own, however, that I should not like
to go alone."</p>

<p>"My dear friend!" cried Jack, "if
you will really be kind enough to
oblige me in this matter, I know the
very man to accompany you. Rogers
of ours is in town just now. He is
a famous follow&mdash;rather fast, perhaps,
and given to larking&mdash;but as true as
steel. You shall meet him to-day at
dinner, and then we can arrange our
plans."</p>

<p>I must own that I did not feel very
sanguine of success this time. Your
genuine rogue is the most suspicious
character on the face of the earth,
wide awake to a thousand little discrepancies
which would escape the
observation of the honest; and I felt
perfectly convinced that the superintendent
of the Agapedome was
likely to prove a rogue of the first
water. Then I did not see my way
clearly to the characters which we
ought to assume. Of course it was
no use for me to present myself as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
scion of the Woods and Forests; I
should be treated as a Government
spy, and have the door slapped in
my face. To appear as an emissary
of the Jesuits would be dangerous;
that body being well known for their
skill in annexing property. In
short, I came to the conclusion, that
unless I could work upon the cupidity
of the head Agapedomian, there was
no chance whatever of effecting Mr
Pettigrew's release. To this point,
therefore, I resolved to turn my attention.</p>

<p>At dinner, according to agreement,
I met Rogers of ours. Rogers was not
gifted with any powerful inventive
faculties; but he was a fine specimen of
the British breed, ready to take a hand
at anything which offered a prospect
of fun. You would not probably
have selected him as a leading conspirator;
but, though no Macchiavelli,
he appeared most valuable as an
accomplice.</p>

<p>Our great difficulty was to pitch
upon proper characters. After much
discussion, it was resolved that Rogers
of ours should appear as a young
nobleman of immense wealth, but
exceedingly eccentric habits, and that
I should act as bear-leader, with an
eye to my own interest. What we
were to do when we should succeed
in getting admission to the establishment,
was not very clear to the perception
of any of us. We resolved
to be regulated entirely by circumstances,
the great point being the
rescue of Mr Peter Pettigrew.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we all started for
Southampton on the following morning.
On arriving there, we were informed
that the Agapedome was situated
some three miles from the town, and
that the most extraordinary legends
of the habits and pursuits of its inmates
were current in the neighbourhood.
Nobody seemed to know exactly
what the Agapedomians were.
They seemed to constitute a tolerably
large society of persons, both male
and female; but whether they were
Christians, Turks, Jews, or Mahometans,
was matter of exceeding disputation.
They were known, however
to be rich, and occasionally went
out airing in carriages-and-four&mdash;the
women all wearing pantaloons, to
the infinite scandal of the peasantry.
So far as we could learn, no gentleman
answering to the description of Mr
Pettigrew had been seen among them.</p>

<p>After agreeing to open communications
with Jack as speedily as possible,
and emptying a bottle of champagne
towards the success of our
expedition, Rogers and I started in
a postchaise for the Agapedome.
Rogers was curiously arrayed in garments
of chequered plaid, a mere
glance at which would have gone far
to impress any spectator with a strong
notion of his eccentricity; whilst, for
my part, I had donned a suit of black,
and assumed a massive pair of gold
spectacles, and a beaver with a portentous
rim.</p>

<p>This Agapedome was a large building
surrounded by a high wall, and
looked, upon the whole, like a convent.
Deeming it prudent to ascertain
how the land lay before introducing
the eccentric Rogers, I requested that
gallant individual to remain in the
postchaise, whilst I solicited an interview
with Mr Aaron B. Hyams, the
reputed chief of the establishment.
The card I sent in was inscribed with
the name of Dr Hiram Smith, which
appeared to me a sufficiently innocuous
appellation. After some delay,
I was admitted through a very
strong gateway into the courtyard;
and was then conducted by a servant
in a handsome livery to a library,
where I was received by Mr Hyams.</p>

<p>As the Agapedome has since been
broken up, and its members dispersed,
it may not be uninteresting to put on
record a slight sketch of its founder.
Judging from his countenance, the progenitors
of Mr Aaron B. Hyams must
have been educated in the Jewish
persuasion. His nose and lip possessed
that graceful curve which is so characteristic
of the Hebrew race; and
his eye, if not altogether of that kind
which the poets designate as "eagle,"
might not unaptly be compared to
that of the turkey-buzzard. In certain
circles of society Mr Hyams
would have been esteemed a handsome
man. In the doorway of a warehouse
in Holywell Street he would
have committed large havoc on the
hearts of the passing Leahs and
Dalilahs&mdash;for he was a square-built
powerful man, with broad shoulders
and bandy legs, and displayed on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
person as much ostentatious jewellery
as though he had been concerned in
a new spoiling of the Egyptians.
Apparently he was in a cheerful
mood; for before him stood a half-emptied
decanter of wine, and an
odour as of recently extinguished
Cubas was agreeably disseminated
through the apartment.</p>

<p>"Dr Hiram Smith, I presume?"
said he. "Well, Dr Hiram Smith,
to what fortunate circumstance am
I indebted for the honour of this
visit?"</p>

<p>"Simply, sir, to this," said I, "that
I want to know you, and know about
you. Nobody without can tell me
precisely what your Agapedome is,
so I have come for information to
headquarters. I have formed my
own conclusion. If I am wrong, there
is no harm done; if I am right, we
may be able to make a bargain."</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried Hyams, taken
rather aback by this curt style of
exordium, "you are a rum customer,
I reckon. So you want to deal, do
ye? Well then, tell us what sort of
doctor you may be? No use standing
on ceremony with a chap like you.
Is it M.D. or LL.D. or D.D., or a
mere walking-stick title?"</p>

<p>"The title," said I, "is conventional;
so you may attribute it to any
origin you please. In brief, I want
to know if I can board a pupil here?"</p>

<p>"That depends entirely upon circumstances,"
replied Hyams. "Who
and what is the subject?"</p>

<p>"A young nobleman of the highest
distinction, but of slightly eccentric
habits." Here Hyams pricked up his
ears. "I am not authorised to tell
his name; but otherwise, you shall
have the most satisfactory references."</p>

<p>"There is only one kind of reference
I care about," interrupted
Hyams, imitating at the same time
the counting out of imaginary sovereigns
into his palm.</p>

<p>"So much the better&mdash;there will
be trouble saved," said I. "I perceive,
Mr Hyams, you are a thorough
man of business. In a word, then,
my pupil has been going it too fast."</p>

<p>"Flying kites and post-obits?"</p>

<p>"And all the rest of it," said I;
"black-legs innumerable, and no end
of scrapes in the green-room. Things
have come to such a pass that his
father, the Duke, insists on his being
kept out of the way at present; and,
as taking him to Paris would only
make matters worse, it occurred to
me that I might locate him for a
time in some quiet but cheerful establishment,
where he could have his
reasonable swing, and no questions
asked."</p>

<p>"Dr Hiram Smith!" cried Hyams
with enthusiasm, "you're a regular
trump! I wish all the noblemen
in England would look out for tutors
like you."</p>

<p>"You are exceedingly complimentary,
Mr Hyams. And now that you
know my errand, may I ask what the
Agapedome is?"</p>

<p>"The Home of Love," replied
Hyams; "at least so I was told by
the Oxford gent, to whom I gave
half-a-guinea for the title."</p>

<p>"And your object?"</p>

<p>"A pleasant retreat&mdash;comfortable
home&mdash;no sort of bother of ceremony&mdash;innocent
attachments encouraged&mdash;and,
in the general case, community
of goods."</p>

<p>"Of which latter, I presume, Mr
Hyams is the sole administrator?"</p>

<p>"Right again, Doctor!" said
Hyams with a leer of intelligence;
"no use beating about the bush with
you, I perceive. A single cashier for
the whole concern saves a world of
unnecessary trouble. Then, you see,
we have our little matrimonial arrangements.
A young lady in search
of an eligible domicile comes here
and deposits her fortune. We provide
her by-and-by with a husband of
suitable tastes, so that all matters are
arranged comfortably. No luxury or
enjoyment is denied to the inmates of
the establishment, which may be
compared, in short, to a perfect
aviary, in which you hear nothing
from morning to evening save one
continuous sound of billing and cooing."</p>

<p>"You draw a fascinating picture,
Mr Hyams," said I: "too fascinating,
in fact; for, after what you have
said, I doubt whether I should be fulfilling
my duty to my noble patron
the Duke, were I to expose his heir
to the influence of such powerful
temptations."</p>

<p>"Don't be in the least degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
alarmed about that," said Hyams.
"I shall take care that in this case
there is no chance of marriage.
Harkye, Doctor, it is rather against
our rules to admit parlour boarders;
but I don't mind doing it in this case,
if you agree to my terms, which are
one hundred and twenty guineas per
month."</p>

<p>"On the part of the Duke," said I,
"I anticipate no objection; nor shall
I refuse your stamped receipts at that
rate. But as I happen to be paymaster,
I shall certainly not give you
in exchange for each of them more
than seventy guineas, which will leave
you a very pretty profit over and
above your expenses."</p>

<p>"What a screw you are, Doctor!"
cried Hyams. "Would you have the
conscience to pocket fifty for nothing?
Come, come&mdash;make it eighty and it's
a bargain."</p>

<p>"Seventy is my last word. Beard
of Mordecai, man! do you think I am
going to surrender this pigeon to your
hands gratis? Have I not told you
already that he has a natural turn for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ecarté</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Doctor, Doctor! you must
be one of our people&mdash;you must indeed!"
said Hyams. "Well, is it a
bargain?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said I. "In common
decency, and for the sake of appearances,
I must stay for a couple of
days in the house, in order that I may
be able to give a satisfactory report
to the Duke. By the way, I hope
everything is quite orthodox here&mdash;nothing
contrary to the tenets of the
church?"</p>

<p>"O quite," replied Hyams; "it is
a beautiful establishment in point of
order. The bell rings every day
punctually at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"For prayers?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;for hockey. We find
that a little lively exercise gives a
cheerful tone to the mind, and promotes
those animal spirits which are
the peculiar boast of the Agapedome."</p>

<p>"I am quite satisfied," said I.
"So now, if you please, I shall introduce
my pupil."</p>

<p>I need not dwell minutely upon the
particulars of the interview which
took place between Rogers of ours
and the superintendent of the Agapedome.
Indeed there is little to
record. Rogers received the intimation
that this was to be his residence
for a season with the utmost nonchalance,
simply remarking that he
thought it would be rather slow; and
then, by way of keeping up his character,
filled himself a bumper of
sherry. Mr Hyams regarded him as
a spider might do when some unknown
but rather powerful insect
comes within the precincts of his net.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rogers, "since it
seems I am to be quartered here,
what sort of fun is to be had? Any
racket-court, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, my Lord, ours
is not built as yet. But at four
o'clock we shall have hockey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hang hockey! I have no fancy
for getting my shins bruised. Any
body in the house except myself?"</p>

<p>"If your Lordship would like to
visit the ladies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say no more!" cried Rogers impetuously.
"I shall manage to kill
time now! 'Hallo, you follow with
the shoulder-knot! show me the way
to the drawing-room;" and Rogers
straightway disappeared.</p>

<p>"Doctor Hiram Smith!" said
Hyams, looking rather discomposed,
"this is most extraordinary conduct
on the part of your pupil."</p>

<p>"Not at all extraordinary, I assure
you," I replied; "I told you he was
rather eccentric, but at present he is
in a peculiarly quiet mood. Wait
till you see his animal spirits up!"</p>

<p>"Why, he'll be the ruin of the
Agapedome!" cried Hyams; "I cannot
possibly permit this."</p>

<p>"It will rather puzzle you to stop
it," said I.</p>

<p>Here a faint squall, followed by a
sound of suppressed giggling, was
heard in the passage without.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" cried the Agapedomian,
starting up, "if Mrs Hyams
should happen to be there!"</p>

<p>"You may rely upon it she will
very soon become accustomed to his
Lordship's eccentricities. Why, you
told me you admitted of no sort of
bother or ceremony."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but a joke maybe carried
too far. As I live, he is pursuing one
of the ladies down stairs into the
courtyard!"</p>

<p>"Is he?" said I; "then you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
be tolerably certain he will overtake
her."</p>

<p>"Surely some of the servants will
stop him!" cried Hyams, rushing to
the window. "Yes&mdash;here comes one
of them. Father Abraham! is it possible?
He has knocked Adoniram
down!"</p>

<p>"Nothing more likely," said I;
"his Lordship had lessons from Mendoza."</p>

<p>"I must look to this myself," cried
Hyams.</p>

<p>"Then I'll follow and see fair
play," said I.</p>

<p>We rushed into the court; but by
this time it was empty. The pursued
and the pursuer&mdash;Daphne and Apollo&mdash;had
taken flight into the garden.
Thither we followed them, Hyams
red with ire; but no trace was seen
of the fugitives. At last in an acacia
bower we heard murmurs. Hyams
dashed on; I followed; and there, to
my unutterable surprise, I beheld
Rogers of ours kneeling at the feet of
the Latchley!</p>

<p>"Beautiful Lavinia!" he was saying,
just as we turned the corner.</p>

<p>"Sister Latchley!" cried Hyams,
"what is the meaning of all this?"</p>

<p>"Rather let me ask, brother Hyams,"
said the Latchley in unabashed
serenity, "what means this intrusion,
so foreign to the time, and so subversive
of the laws of our society?"</p>

<p>"Shall I pound him, Lavinia?" said
Rogers, evidently anxious to discharge
a slight modicum of the debt which he
owed to the Jewish fraternity.</p>

<p>"I command&mdash;I beseech you, no!
Speak, brother Hyams! I again require
of you to state why and wherefore
you have chosen to violate the
fundamental rules of the Agapedome?"</p>

<p>"Sister Latchley, you will drive me
mad! This young man has not been
ten minutes in the house, and yet I
find him scampering after you like a
tom-cat, and knocking down Adoniram
because he came in his way, and
you are apparently quite pleased!"</p>

<p>"Is the influence of love measured
by hours?" asked the Latchley in a
tone of deep sentiment. "Count we
electricity by time&mdash;do we mete out
sympathy by the dial? Brother
Hyams, were not your intellectual
vision obscured by a dull and earthly
film, you would know that the passage
of the lightning is not more rapid
than the flash of kindled love."</p>

<p>"That sounds all very fine," said
Hyams, "but I shall allow no such
doings here; and you, in particular,
Sister Latchley, considering how you
are situated, ought to be ashamed of
yourself!"</p>

<p>"Aaron, my man," said Rogers of
ours, "will you be good enough to
explain what you mean by making
such insinuations?"</p>

<p>"Stay, my Lord," said I; "I really
must interpose. Mr Hyams is about
to explain."</p>

<p>"May I never discount bill again,"
cried the Jew, "if this is not enough
to make a man forswear the faith of
his fathers! Look you here, Miss
Latchley; you are part of the establishment,
and I expect you to obey
orders."</p>

<p>"I was not aware, sir, until this
moment," said Miss Latchley, loftily,
"that I was subject to the orders of
any one."</p>

<p>"Now, don't be a fool; there's a
dear!" said Hyams. "You know
well enough what I mean. Haven't
you enough on hand with Pettigrew,
without encumbering yourself&mdash;?"
and he stopped short.</p>

<p>"It is a pity, sir," said Miss
Latchley, still more magnificently,
"it is a vast pity, that since you have
the meanness to invent falsehoods,
you cannot at the same time command
the courage to utter them.
Why am I thus insulted? Who is
this Pettigrew you speak of?"</p>

<p>"Pettigrew&mdash;Pettigrew?" remarked
Rogers; "I say, Dr Smith, was
not that the name of the man who is
gone amissing, and for whose discovery
his friends are offering a reward?"</p>

<p>Hyams started as if stung by an
adder. "Sister Latchley," he said,
"I fear I was in the wrong."</p>

<p>"You have made the discovery
rather too late, Mr Hyams," replied
the irate Lavinia. "After the insults
you have heaped upon me, it is full
time we should part. Perhaps these
gentlemen will be kind enough to
conduct an unprotected female to a
temporary home."</p>

<p>"If you will go, you go alone,
madam," said Hyams; "his Lordship
intends to remain here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>"His Lordship intends to do nothing
of the sort, you rascal," said
Rogers. "Hockey don't agree with
my constitution."</p>

<p>"Before I depart, Mr Hyams,"
said Miss Latchley, "let me remark
that you are indebted to me in the
sum of two thousand pounds as my
share of the profits of the establishment.
Will you pay it now, or would
you prefer to wait till you hear from
my solicitor?"</p>

<p>"Anything more?" asked the
Agapedomian.</p>

<p>"Merely this," said I: "I am
now fully aware that Mr Peter Pettigrew
is detained within these walls.
Surrender him instantly, or prepare
yourself for the worst penalties of the
law."</p>

<p>I made a fearful blunder in betraying
my secret before I was clear of
the premises, and the words had
scarcely passed my lips before I was
aware of my mistake. With the look
of a detected demon Hyams confronted
us.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! this is a conspiracy, is
it? But you have reckoned without
your host. Ho, there! Jonathan&mdash;Asahel!
close the doors, ring the
great bell, and let no man pass on
your lives! And now let's see what
stuff you are made of!"</p>

<p>So saying, the ruffian drew a life-preserver
from his pocket, and struck
furiously at my head before I had
time to guard myself. But quick as
he was, Rogers of ours was quicker.
With his left hand he caught the arm
of Hyams as the blow descended,
whilst with the right he dealt him a
fearful blow on the temple, which
made the Hebrew stagger. But
Hyams, amongst his other accomplishments,
had practised in the ring. He
recovered himself almost immediately,
and rushed upon Rogers. Several
heavy hits were interchanged; and
there is no saying how the combat
might have terminated, but for the
presence of mind of the Latchley.
That gifted female, superior to the
weakness of her sex, caught up the
life-preserver from the ground, and
applied it so effectually to the back of
Hyams' skull, that he dropped like an
ox in the slaughter-house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the alarum bell was
ringing&mdash;women were screaming at
the windows, from which also several
crazy-looking gentlemen were gesticulating;
and three or four truculent
Israelites were rushing through the
courtyard. The whole Agapedome
was in an uproar.</p>

<p>"Keep together and fear nothing!"
cried Rogers. "I never stir on these
kind of expeditions without my
pistols. Smith&mdash;give your arm to
Miss Latchley, who has behaved like
the heroine of Saragossa; and now
let us see if any of these scoundrels
will venture to dispute our way!"</p>

<p>But for the firearms which Rogers
carried, I suspect our egress would
have been disputed. Jonathan and
Asahel, red-headed ruffians both,
stood ready with iron bars in their
hands to oppose our exit; but a
glimpse of the bright glittering
barrel caused them to change their
purpose. Rogers commanded them,
on pain of instant death, to open the
door. They obeyed; and we emerged
from the Agapedome as joyfully as
the Ithacans from the cave of Polyphemus.
Fortunately the chaise was
still in waiting: we assisted Miss
Latchley in, and drove off, as fast as
the horses could gallop, to Southampton.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>"Is it possible they can have
murdered him?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"That, I think," said I, "is highly
improbable. I rather imagine that
he has refused to conform to some of
the rules of the association, and has
been committed to the custody of
Messrs Jonathan and Asahel."</p>

<p>"Shall I ask Lavinia?" said
Rogers. "I daresay she would tell
me all about it."</p>

<p>"Better not," said I, "in the
mean time. Poor thing! her nerves
must be shaken."</p>

<p>"Not a whit of them," replied
Rogers. "I saw no symptom of
nerves about her. She was as cool
as a cucumber when she floored that
infernal Jew; and if she should be a
little agitated or so, she is calming
herself at this moment with a glass
of brandy and water. I mixed it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
her. Do you know she's a capital fellow,
only 'tis a pity she's so very plain."</p>

<p>"I wish the police would arrive!"
said Jack. "We have really not
a minute to lose. Poor Uncle Peter!
I devoutly trust this may be the
last of his freaks."</p>

<p>"I hope so too, Jack, for your
sake: it is no joke rummaging him
out of such company. But for Rogers
there, we should all of us have been
as dead as pickled herrings."</p>

<p>"I bear a charmed life," said
Rogers. "Remember I belong to
'the Immortals.' But there come the
blue-coats in a couple of carriages.
'Gad, Wilkinson, I wish it were our
luck to storm the Agapedome with a
score of our own fellows!"</p>

<p>During our drive, Rogers enlightened
us as to his encounter with the
Latchley. It appeared that he had
bestowed considerable attention to
our conversation in London; and
that, when he hurried to the drawing-room
in the Agapedome, as
already related, he thought he recognised
the Latchley at once, in the
midst of half-a-dozen more juvenile
and blooming sisters.</p>

<p>"Of course, I never read a word
of the woman's works," said Rogers,
"and I hope I never shall; but I know
that female vanity will stand any
amount of butter. So I bolted into
the room, without caring for the rest&mdash;though,
by the way, there was
one little girl with fair hair and blue
eyes, who, I hope, has not left the
Agapedome&mdash;threw myself at the feet
of Lavinia; declared that I was a
young nobleman, enamoured of her
writings, who was resolved to force
my way through iron bars to gain a
glimpse of the bright original: and,
upon the whole, I think you must
allow that I managed matters rather
successfully."</p>

<p>There could be but one opinion as
to that. In fact, without Rogers,
the whole scheme must have miscarried.
It was Kellermann's charge,
unexpected and unauthorised&mdash;but
altogether triumphant.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Agapedome we
found the door open, and three or
four peasants loitering round the
gateway.</p>

<p>"Are they here still?" cried Jack,
springing from the chaise.</p>

<p>"Noa, measter," replied one of the
bystanders; "they be gone an hour
past in four carrutches, wi' all their
goods and chuckles."</p>

<p>"Did they carry any one with
them by force?"</p>

<p>"Noa, not by force, as I seed; but
there wore one chap among them
woundily raddled on the sconce."</p>

<p>"Hyams to wit, I suppose. Come,
gentlemen; as we have a search-warrant,
let us in and examine the
premises thoroughly."</p>

<p>Short as was the interval which had
elapsed between our exit and return,
Messrs Jonathan, Asahel, and Co.
had availed themselves of it to the
utmost. Every portable article of
any value had been removed. Drawers
were open, and papers scattered
over the floors, along with a good
many pairs of bloomers rather the
worse for the wear: in short, every
thing seemed to indicate that the
nest was finally abandoned. What
curious discoveries we made during
the course of our researches, as to the
social habits and domestic economy
of this happy family, I shall not venture
to recount; we came there not
to gratify either private or public
curiosity, but to perform a sacred duty
by emancipating Mr Peter Pettigrew.</p>

<p>Neither in the cellars nor the
closets, nor even in the garrets, could
we find any trace of the lost one.
The contents of one bedroom, indeed,
showed that it had been formerly
tenanted by Mr Pettigrew, for there
were his portmanteaus with his name
engraved upon them; his razors, and
his wearing apparel, all seemingly untouched:
but there were no marks of
any recent occupancy; the dust was
gathering on the table, and the ewer
perfectly dry. It was the opinion of
the detective officer that at least ten
days had elapsed since any one had
slept in the room. Jack became
greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said he, "there is
nothing for it but to proceed immediately
in pursuit of Hyams: do you
think you will be able to apprehend
him?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it very much, sir,"
replied the detective officer. "These
sort of fellows are wide awake, and
are always prepared for accidents. I
expect that, by this time, he is on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
way to France. But hush!&mdash;what
was that?"</p>

<p>A dull sound as of the clapper of a
large bell boomed overhead. There
was silence for about a minute, and
again it was repeated.</p>

<p>"Here is a clue, at all events!"
cried the officer. "My life on it,
there is some one in the belfry."</p>

<p>We hastened up the narrow stairs
which led to the tower. Half way
up, the passage was barred by a stout
door, double locked, which the officers
had some difficulty in forcing with the
aid of a crow-bar. This obstacle removed,
we reached the lofty room
where the bell was suspended; and
there, right under the clapper, on a
miserable truckle bed, lay the emaciated
form of Mr Pettigrew.</p>

<p>"My poor uncle!" said Jack,
stooping tenderly to embrace his
relative, "what can have brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"Speak louder, Jack!" said Mr
Pettigrew; "I can't hear you. For
twelve long days that infernal bell
has been tolling just above my head
for hockey and other villanous purposes.
I am as deaf as a doornail!"</p>

<p>"And so thin, dear uncle! You
must have been most shamefully
abused."</p>

<p>"Simply starved; that's all."</p>

<p>"What! starved? The monsters!
Did they give you nothing to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;broccoli. I wish you would
try it for a week: it is a rare thing to
bring out the bones."</p>

<p>"And why did they commit this
outrage upon you?"</p>

<p>"For two especial reasons, I suppose&mdash;first,
because I would not surrender
my whole property; and,
secondly, because I would not marry
Miss Latchley."</p>

<p>"My dear uncle! when I saw you
last, it appeared to me that you would
have had no objections to perform the
latter ceremony."</p>

<p>"Not on compulsion, Jack&mdash;not on
compulsion!" said Mr Pettigrew, with
a touch of his old humour. "I won't
deny that I was humbugged by her at
first, but this was over long ago."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Pray, may I venture
to ask what changed your opinion of
the lady?"</p>

<p>"Her works, Jack&mdash;her own works!"
replied Uncle Peter. "She gave me
them to read as soon as I was fairly
trapped into the Agapedome, and
such an awful collection of impiety
and presumption I never saw before.
She is ten thousand times worse than
the deceased Thomas Paine."</p>

<p>"Was she, then, party to your
incarceration?"</p>

<p>"I won't say that. I hardly think
she would have consented to let them
harm me, or that she knew exactly
how I was used; but that fellow
Hyams is wicked enough to have been
an officer under King Herod. Now,
pray help me up, and lift me down
stairs, for my legs are so cramped
that I can't walk, and my head is as
dizzy as a wheel. That confounded
broccoli, too, has disagreed with my
constitution, and I shall feel particularly
obliged to any one who can
assist me to a drop of brandy."</p>

<p>After having ministered to the immediate
wants of Mr Pettigrew, and
secured his effects, we returned to
Southampton, leaving the deserted
Agapedome in the charge of a couple
of police. In spite of every entreaty
Mr Pettigrew would not hear of entering
a prosecution against Hyams.</p>

<p>"I feel," said he, "that I have
made a thorough ass of myself; and
I should not be able to stand the ridicule
that must follow a disclosure of
the consequences. In fact, I begin to
think that I am not fit to look after
my own affairs. The man who has
spent twelve days, as I have, under
the clapper of a bell, without any
other sustenance than broccoli&mdash;is
there any more brandy in the flask?
I should like the merest drop&mdash;the
man, I say, who has undergone these
trials, has ample time for meditation
upon the past. I see my weakness,
and I acknowledge it. So Jack, my
dear boy, as you have always behaved
to me more like a son than a nephew,
I intend, immediately on my return
to London, to settle my whole property
upon you, merely reserving an
annuity. Don't say a word on the
subject. My mind is made up, and
nothing can alter my resolution."</p>

<p>On arriving at Southampton we
considered it our duty to communicate
immediately with Miss Latchley,
for the purpose of ascertaining if we
could render her any temporary assistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Perhaps it was more than she
deserved; but we could not forget her
sex, though she had done everything
in her power to disguise it; and,
besides, the lucky blow with the life-preserver,
which she administered to
Hyams, was a service for which we
could not be otherwise than grateful.
Jack Wilkinson was selected as the
medium of communication. He found
the strong Lavinia alone, and perfectly
composed.</p>

<p>"I wish never more," said she, "to
hear the name of Pettigrew. It is
associated in my mind with weakness,
fanaticism, and vacillation; and I
shall ever feel humbled at the reflection
that I bowed my woman's pride
to gaze on the surface of so shallow
and opaque a pool! And yet, why
regret? The image of the sun is reflected
equally from the B&oelig;otian
marsh and the mirror of the clear
Ontario! Tell your uncle," continued
she, after a pause, "that as he is nothing
to me, so I wish to be nothing
to him. Let us mutually extinguish
memory. Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;so they fed
him, you say, upon broccoli?</p>

<p>"But I have one message to give,
though not to him. The youth who,
in the nobility of his soul, declared
his passion for my intellect&mdash;where is
he? I tarry beneath this roof but for
him. Do my message fairly, and say
to him that if he seeks a communion
of soul&mdash;no! that is the common
phrase of the slaves of antiquated
superstition&mdash;if he yearns for a grand
amalgamation of essential passion
and power, let him hasten hither, and
Lavinia Latchley is ready to accompany
him to the prairie or the forest,
to the torrid zone, or to the confines
of the arctic seas!"</p>

<p>"I shall deliver your message,
ma'am," said Jack, "as accurately as
my abilities will allow." And he
did so.</p>

<p>Rogers of ours writhed uneasily in
his seat.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, my fine
fellows," said he, "I don't look upon
this quite as a laughing matter. I
am really sorry to have taken in the
old woman, though I don't see how
we could well have helped it; and I
would far rather, Jack, that she had
fixed her affections upon you than
on me. I shall get infernally roasted
at the mess if this story should
transpire. However, I suppose
there's only one answer to be given.
Pray, present my most humble respects,
and say how exceedingly distressed
I feel that my professional
engagements will not permit me to
accompany her in her proposed expedition."</p>

<p>Jack reported the answer in due
form.</p>

<p>"Then," said Lavinia, drawing
herself up to her full height, and
shrouding her visage in a black veil,
"tell him that for his sake I am resolved
to die a virgin!"</p>

<p>I presume she will keep her word;
at least I have not yet heard that any
one has been courageous enough to
request her to change her situation.
She has since returned to America,
and is now, I believe, the president
of a female college, the students of
which may be distinguished from the
rest of their sex, by their uniform
adoption of bloomers.</p>

muscles; and, if the action is at all energetic, a number of muscles are brought into
play as an equipoise or balance; the infant, therefore, would be sadly puzzled
amongst its muscular sensations, supposing that it had them. Besides, it seems clear
that those movements we see an infant make with its arms and legs are, in the first
instance, as little <em>voluntary</em> as the muscular movements it makes for the purpose of
respiration. There is an animal life within us, dependent on its own laws of irritability.
Over a portion of this the developed thought or reason gains dominion;
over a large portion the will never has any hold; over another portion, as in the
organs of respiration, it has an intermittent and divided empire. We learn voluntary
movement by doing that instinctively and spontaneously which we afterwards do
from forethought. We have moved our arm; we wish to do the like again, (and to
our wonder, if we then had intelligence enough to wonder,) we do it.</p></div>

assumes both names,) gave the right of voting at the election of members of the
popular assembly to every man who had a hearth of his own&mdash;whether he occupied
a whole house or a single room&mdash;in fact, to all heads of families and self-supporting
persons. Such extent of suffrage ought surely to content the most democratic, and
certainly presents a strong contrast to the farce of national representation which has

both of them highly respectable journals, conducted with much ability and moderation,
unceasingly reiterate, whilst exposing the vices and corruption of the present system,
their aversion to despotism, and their desire for a truly liberal and constitutional
government.</p></div>

"Carlos Luis," and issued from Bourges in May 1845, or consider it as in the
slightest degree disproving what we have advanced. It contains no distinct pledge or
guarantee of constitutional government, but deals in frothy generalities and magniloquent
protestations, binding to nothing the prince who signed it, and bearing more
traces of the pen of a Jesuit priest than of that of a competent and statesmanlike
adviser of a youthful aspirant to a throne.</p></div></div>
